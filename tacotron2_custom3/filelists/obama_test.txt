../obama_wave/O8_142.wav|doesn't matter of national Security
../obama_wave/O8_143.wav|we also need to make it harder for people to buy power

../obama_wave/O8_17.wav|so far we have no evidence that The Killers were directed
../obama_wave/O8_170.wav|what we should not do

../obama_wave/O8_209.wav|is a real problem that Muslims
../obama_wave/O8_21.wav|turn down the dark path of radicalisation

../obama_wave/O8_70.wav|many Americans are asking whether we are
../obama_wave/O8_71.wav|buy a cancer that has no immediate cure
../obama_wave/O8_72.wav|well here's what
../obama_wave/O8_73.wav|the Threat from terrorism
../obama_wave/O8_74.wav|but we will overcome it
../obama_wave/O8_75.wav|we will destroy isil and any other organiz
../obama_wave/O8_76.wav|our success
../obama_wave/O8_77.wav|depend on tough talk or abandoning our values
../obama_wave/O8_78.wav|we're giving into fear that's what groups like
../obama_wave/O8_79.wav|are hoping for
../obama_wave/O8_8.wav|each of them serve their fellow citizens
../obama_wave/O8_80.wav|add we will prevail by being strong and smart
../obama_wave/O8_81.wav|resilient and relentless
../obama_wave/O8_82.wav|and by drawing upon every aspect of
../obama_wave/O8_83.wav|here's how
../obama_wave/O8_84.wav|first arm military
../obama_wave/O8_85.wav|continue to hunt down terrace Platters in any
../obama_wave/O8_86.wav|country where it is necessary
../obama_wave/O8_88.wav|heavy weapons oil tankers
../obama_wave/O8_89.wav|and since the attacks in Paris are
../obama_wave/O8_9.wav|all of them were part of our American family
../obama_wave/O8_90.wav|including France Germany and The United
../obama_wave/O8_91.wav|have ramped up their contributions to our
../obama_wave/O8_92.wav|campaign which will help us Accelerate our effort
../obama_wave/O8_93.wav|to destroy isil
../obama_wave/O8_94.wav|second we will continue to provide training and equipment
../obama_wave/O8_95.wav|tens of thousands of a rocky and Syrian forces
../obama_wave/O8_96.wav|fighting isil on the ground so that we take away
../obama_wave/O8_97.wav|in both countries were deploy
../obama_wave/O8_98.wav|special operations forces who can Accelerate that offensive
../obama_wave/O8_99.wav|we've stepped up this effort since the attack
../obama_wave/O9_1.wav|good evening today
../obama_wave/O9_10.wav|reference is to resolve this issue peacefully
../obama_wave/O9_101.wav|the Coalition that enabled our sanctions to be enfor
../obama_wave/O9_102.wav|in the first place that International
../obama_wave/O9_103.wav|is on display today the world
../obama_wave/O9_104.wav|United in support of our determination to
../obama_wave/O9_105.wav|Ron from developing a nuclear weapon
../obama_wave/O9_106.wav|Iran must know that security and prosperity will never
../obama_wave/O9_107.wav|come through the pursuit of nuclear weapons it must
../obama_wave/O9_108.wav|reach through fully verifiable agreements
../obama_wave/O9_109.wav|iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons impossible
../obama_wave/O9_11.wav|and we've extended the hand of diplomacy
../obama_wave/O9_110.wav|as we go forward the resolve of
../obama_wave/O9_111.wav|states will remain firm as will our commitments
../obama_wave/O9_112.wav|friends and allies particularly Israel and our golf
../obama_wave/O9_113.wav|so we have good reason to be sceptical about iran's in
../obama_wave/O9_114.wav|ultimately only
../obama_wave/O9_115.wav|diplomacy can bring about a durable solution
../obama_wave/O9_116.wav|to the challenge posed by iran's nuclear program
../obama_wave/O9_117.wav|as president and commander in chief
../obama_wave/O9_118.wav|what is necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a
../obama_wave/O9_119.wav|but I have a profound
../obama_wave/O9_12.wav|yeah for many years iran's been unwilling
../obama_wave/O9_120.wav|responsibility to try to resolve our differences peacefully
../obama_wave/O9_121.wav|rather than rush towards conflict
../obama_wave/O9_122.wav|today we have a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive
../obama_wave/O9_124.wav|the first step that we've taken today
../obama_wave/O9_125.wav|marks the most significant intangible progress
../obama_wave/O9_126.wav|made with Iran since I took office and
../obama_wave/O9_127.wav|I must use the monster head to pursue a lasting
../obama_wave/O9_129.wav|and our security and the security of our allies for decades
../obama_wave/O9_13.wav|it's obligations to the international community
../obama_wave/O9_130.wav|it won't be easy and huge
../obama_wave/O9_132.wav|principal diplomacy the United States of America
../obama_wave/O9_133.wav|do our part on behalf of a world of
../obama_wave/O9_134.wav|security and cooperation
../obama_wave/O9_135.wav|among Nations thank you very much
../obama_wave/O9_14.wav|some administration work with congress
../obama_wave/O9_15.wav|the United Nations Security Council and country
../obama_wave/O9_16.wav|impose unprecedented sanctions on the
../obama_wave/O9_17.wav|government these sanctions have had
../obama_wave/O9_18.wav|substantial impact on the Iranian economy and with the
../obama_wave/O9_19.wav|of a new Iranian president earlier this year
../obama_wave/O9_2.wav|United States together with our Close allies
../obama_wave/O9_20.wav|an opening for diplomacy emerged
../obama_wave/O9_21.wav|I spoke personally with president rohani
../obama_wave/O9_22.wav|secretary Kerry
../obama_wave/O9_23.wav|is mad multiple times with iran's foreign minister
../obama_wave/O9_24.wav|and we have pursued intensive diplomacy
../obama_wave/O9_25.wav|bilaterally with the Iranians and together
../obama_wave/O9_26.wav|repeat 5 + 1 partners the United Kingdom
../obama_wave/O9_27.wav|France Germany Russia and China
../obama_wave/O9_28.wav|as well as the European Union
../obama_wave/O9_29.wav|today bad diplomacy opened up a new path
../obama_wave/O9_3.wav|took an important first step
../obama_wave/O9_30.wav|tour the world that is more secure
../obama_wave/O9_31.wav|temperature in which we can verify that iran's nuclear program
../obama_wave/O9_33.wav|what's today's
../obama_wave/O9_34.wav|is just a first step it achieves
../obama_wave/O9_35.wav|for the first time in nearly
../obama_wave/O9_36.wav|play we have halted the progress of the Iranian
../obama_wave/O9_37.wav|your program and keep parts of the program will
../obama_wave/O9_38.wav|roll back around as committed
../obama_wave/O9_39.wav|halting certain levels of enrichment and neutralising
../obama_wave/O9_4.wav|comprehensive solution that addresses our concerns
../obama_wave/O9_41.wav|can I use it's next generation centrifuges which are
../obama_wave/O9_42.wav|for enriching uranium Iran cannot
../obama_wave/O9_43.wav|call or startup new centrifuges and it's
../obama_wave/O9_45.wav|plutonium reactor
../obama_wave/O9_46.wav|add new inspections will provide extensive access
../obama_wave/O9_47.wav|iran's nuclear facilities and allow the
../obama_wave/O9_48.wav|national community to verify whether Iran is
../obama_wave/O9_49.wav|these are
../obama_wave/O9_5.wav|will the Islamic Republic of iran's nuclear program
../obama_wave/O9_50.wav|cancel limitations which will help prevent Iran
../obama_wave/O9_51.wav|from building a nuclear weapon simply
../obama_wave/O9_53.wav|meanwhile this first
../obama_wave/O9_54.wav|create time and space over the next 6 months
../obama_wave/O9_55.wav|more negotiation to fully address our comprehensive
../obama_wave/O9_56.wav|concerns about the Iranian program
../obama_wave/O9_57.wav|because of this agreement Iran cannot use negot
../obama_wave/O9_58.wav|has covered to advance its program
../obama_wave/O9_59.wav|on our side the United
../obama_wave/O9_6.wav|since I took office
../obama_wave/O9_60.wav|is and our friends and allies have agreed to provide IR
../obama_wave/O9_61.wav|modest relief while continuing to apply
../obama_wave/O9_62.wav|sanctions we will refrain from
../obama_wave/O9_63.wav|closing new sanctions and we will allow the IR
../obama_wave/O9_64.wav|government access to a portion of the revenue
../obama_wave/O9_65.wav|have been denied through sanctions
../obama_wave/O9_66.wav|what the broader Architecture of sanctions will
../obama_wave/O9_67.wav|place and we will continue to enforce them vigorous
../obama_wave/O9_69.wav|ring the 6-month phase we will turn off the
../obama_wave/O9_7.wav|I've made clear my determination to prevent
../obama_wave/O9_70.wav|and ratchet up the pressure
../obama_wave/O9_71.wav|over the next 6 months we will work to negotiate
../obama_wave/O9_74.wav|like any nation should be able to access
../obama_wave/O9_75.wav|peaceful nuclear energy
../obama_wave/O9_76.wav|Elizabeth's record of violating its obligations
../obama_wave/O9_77.wav|run must accept strict limitations on its
../obama_wave/O9_78.wav|program that make it impossible to develop a NUC
../obama_wave/O9_79.wav|in these negot
../obama_wave/O9_8.wav|Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon
../obama_wave/O9_80.wav|nothing will be agreed to unless everything
../obama_wave/O9_81.wav|the burden is on
../obama_wave/O9_82.wav|to prove to the world that it's nuclear program
../obama_wave/O9_83.wav|will be exclusively for peaceful
../obama_wave/O9_84.wav|if we're on Caesars
../obama_wave/O9_85.wav|the Iranian people will benefit from
../obama_wave/O9_86.wav|rejoining the international community and we can begin to
../obama_wave/O9_87.wav|simple way of the mistrust between our Two Nations
../obama_wave/O9_88.wav|this would provide a run with a dignified path
../obama_wave/O9_89.wav|the Forge a new beginning with the wider
../obama_wave/O9_9.wav|as I've said many times my
../obama_wave/O9_90.wav|based on mutual respect
../obama_wave/O9_91.wav|on the other hand Iran refuses it will face
../obama_wave/O9_92.wav|drawing pressure in isolation
../obama_wave/O9_93.wav|over the last few years Congress has been a key partner
../obama_wave/O9_94.wav|closing sanctions on the Iranian government and that
../obama_wave/O9_97.wav|continue to work closely with Congress how
../obama_wave/O9_98.wav|how is not the time to move forward on new sanctions
../obama_wave/O9_99.wav|because doing so with derail this promising first step
