../obama_wave/O10_116.wav|Pakistan help lead us to bin Laden
../obama_wave/O10_117.wav|and the compound where he was hiding
../obama_wave/O10_118.wav|bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as

../obama_wave/O10_28.wav|2001 In Our Time of grief
../obama_wave/O10_29.wav|the American people came together

../obama_wave/O10_4.wav|the killed Osama Bin Laden the lead
../obama_wave/O10_40.wav|special attack to Justice
../obama_wave/O10_41.wav|we quickly learnt that the 9/11 attacks were car
../obama_wave/O10_42.wav|buy Al-Qaeda an organisation headed by
../obama_wave/O10_43.wav|bin Laden which had openly declared War
../obama_wave/O10_44.wav|United States and was committed to killing Innocents in
../obama_wave/O10_45.wav|free and around the globe
../obama_wave/O10_46.wav|to war against Al-Qaeda to protect
../obama_wave/O10_47.wav|distance our friends and our
../obama_wave/O10_48.wav|over the last 10 years
../obama_wave/O10_49.wav|thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our
../obama_wave/O10_5.wav|call qaida and a terrorist who's resp
../obama_wave/O10_50.wav|professionals
../obama_wave/O10_51.wav|we've made great strides in that effort
../obama_wave/O10_52.wav|disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homel
../obama_wave/O10_53.wav|in Afghanistan we remove the
../obama_wave/O10_54.wav|define government which had given bin Laden and Al-Qaeda safe
../obama_wave/O10_55.wav|and support and around the globe
../obama_wave/O10_56.wav|worked with our friends and allies to capture or kill
../obama_wave/O10_57.wav|is a Al-Qaeda terrorists including several Who
../obama_wave/O10_58.wav|part of the 9/11 plot
../obama_wave/O10_59.wav|Osama bin Laden avoided capture
../obama_wave/O10_6.wav|for the murder of thousands of Innocent men
../obama_wave/O10_60.wav|an escape to cross the Afghan border into
../obama_wave/O10_61.wav|meanwhile Al-Qaeda continued
../obama_wave/O10_63.wav|across the world
../obama_wave/O10_64.wav|so shortly after taking office I direct
../obama_wave/O10_65.wav|play antonella the director of the CIA
../obama_wave/O10_66.wav|make the Killing or capture of Bin Laden the
../obama_wave/O10_67.wav|priority of our war against Al-Qaeda
../obama_wave/O10_68.wav|can we continue our broader efforts to disrupt
../obama_wave/O10_7.wav|women and children
../obama_wave/O10_70.wav|then last August after
../obama_wave/O10_71.wav|is a painstaking work by our intelligence community
../obama_wave/O10_72.wav|I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden
../obama_wave/O10_73.wav|it was far from certain it took many
../obama_wave/O10_75.wav|repeatedly with my national security team as we developed
../obama_wave/O10_76.wav|information about the possibility that we have located bin Laden
../obama_wave/O10_77.wav|hiding within a compound deep inside Pak
../obama_wave/O10_78.wav|and finally last week
../obama_wave/O10_79.wav|I determined that we had enough intelligence to
../obama_wave/O10_8.wav|it was nearly 10 years ago
../obama_wave/O10_80.wav|action an authorised an operation to get
../obama_wave/O10_81.wav|Osama bin Laden and bring him to Justice
../obama_wave/O10_82.wav|today at my Direction
../obama_wave/O10_83.wav|the United States launched a targeted operation
../obama_wave/O10_84.wav|what's that compound in a bottle
../obama_wave/O10_85.wav|small team of Americans carried
../obama_wave/O10_86.wav|operation with extraordinary courage and capability
../obama_wave/O10_87.wav|no Americans were harmed
../obama_wave/O10_88.wav|they took care to avoid civilian casualties
../obama_wave/O10_89.wav|after a firefight they killed OS
../obama_wave/O10_9.wav|timber day was darkened by the worst attack on
../obama_wave/O10_90.wav|fun and took custody of his body
../obama_wave/O10_91.wav|for over 2 decades
../obama_wave/O10_92.wav|garden has been al-qaeda's leader and symbol
../obama_wave/O10_93.wav|continue to plot a tax against our country and
../obama_wave/O10_94.wav|the death of Bin Laden
../obama_wave/O10_95.wav|Mark's the most significant achievement to date in our n
../obama_wave/O10_96.wav|effort to defeat Al-Qaeda
../obama_wave/O10_97.wav|does not Mark the end of our effort there
../obama_wave/O10_98.wav|doubt that Al-Qaeda will continue to pursue a tax against
../obama_wave/O10_99.wav|we must and we will
../obama_wave/O11_1.wav|good morning everybody please have a seat
../obama_wave/O11_10.wav|are the kinds that have been supported by Democrats
../obama_wave/O11_100.wav|cultural subsidies subsidies that a lot
../obama_wave/O11_101.wav|times paid large farms for crops that they don't
../obama_wave/O11_102.wav|we make modest
../obama_wave/O11_103.wav|the federal retirement programs
../obama_wave/O11_104.wav|reduce by tens of billions of dollars the tax money
../obama_wave/O11_105.wav|what's the fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
../obama_wave/O11_106.wav|we also asked the largest financial fir
../obama_wave/O11_107.wav|company saved by tax dollars during the
../obama_wave/O11_108.wav|prices to repay the American people for every
../obama_wave/O11_109.wav|and we save
../obama_wave/O11_11.wav|and Republicans in the past
../obama_wave/O11_110.wav|national 1 trillion dollars as we end the
../obama_wave/O11_111.wav|in Iraq and Afghanistan
../obama_wave/O11_112.wav|play savings are not only counted as part of our plan but as part of
../obama_wave/O11_114.wav|voted for
../obama_wave/O11_115.wav|finally this plan includes structural reforms
../obama_wave/O11_116.wav|reduce the cost of health care and programs like Medicare
../obama_wave/O11_117.wav|keep in mind we've already
../obama_wave/O11_118.wav|set a number of reforms in the health care
../obama_wave/O11_119.wav|which will go a long way toward
../obama_wave/O11_12.wav|there shouldn't be any reason for Congress to
../obama_wave/O11_121.wav|this plan reduces wasteful subsidies
../obama_wave/O11_122.wav|payments while changing summon sentence that
../obama_wave/O11_123.wav|to excessive Healthcare costs
../obama_wave/O11_124.wav|next prescriptions more affordable through faster approval
../obama_wave/O11_125.wav|of generic drugs will work with Govan
../obama_wave/O11_126.wav|to make medicaid more efficient and more accountable
../obama_wave/O11_127.wav|and we'll change the way we pay for Healthcare
../obama_wave/O11_128.wav|just paying for procedures
../obama_wave/O11_129.wav|providers will be paid more when they improved
../obama_wave/O11_13.wav|speak they should pass it right away
../obama_wave/O11_130.wav|such steps will save money
../obama_wave/O11_131.wav|and improved care
../obama_wave/O11_132.wav|changes are phased in slowly to
../obama_wave/O11_133.wav|open Medicare and medicaid overtime because
../obama_wave/O11_134.wav|you do need to reduce health care costs I'm not going to allow
../obama_wave/O11_135.wav|to be an excuse for turning Medicare into a
../obama_wave/O11_136.wav|program that leaves seniors at the mercy of the insurance ind
../obama_wave/O11_137.wav|I'm not going to stand for balancing the budget
../obama_wave/O11_138.wav|play denying or reducing health care for poor children or those
../obama_wave/O11_139.wav|disabilities
../obama_wave/O11_14.wav|I'm ready to sign a bill I've got the pens already
../obama_wave/O11_140.wav|Medicare and medicaid but we will not abandon the fundament
../obama_wave/O11_142.wav|and by the way that includes our commitment to Social Security
../obama_wave/O11_143.wav|I've said before Social Security
../obama_wave/O11_144.wav|the primary cause blood deficits but it
../obama_wave/O11_145.wav|face long-term challenges is our country grows old
../obama_wave/O11_146.wav|and both parties are going to need to work together
../obama_wave/O11_147.wav|separate track to strengthen social security for our
../obama_wave/O11_148.wav|grandchild
../obama_wave/O11_149.wav|this is how we can reduce spending by scouring the
../obama_wave/O11_15.wav|now
../obama_wave/O11_150.wav|for every dime of wasting and Efficiency
../obama_wave/O11_151.wav|my reforming government spending and by making
../obama_wave/O11_152.wav|artist adjustments to Medicare and medicaid
../obama_wave/O11_153.wav|but all these reductions
../obama_wave/O11_154.wav|buy themselves will not solve our fiscal problems
../obama_wave/O11_155.wav|we can't just cut
../obama_wave/O11_157.wav|play balanced approach
../obama_wave/O11_158.wav|how to make spending cuts many of which we wouldn't make if
../obama_wave/O11_159.wav|we want facing such large budget Def
../obama_wave/O11_16.wav|play said before Congress should
../obama_wave/O11_160.wav|then it's only right that we ask
../obama_wave/O11_161.wav|I want to pay their fair share
../obama_wave/O11_162.wav|in the last week Speaker of the House John Bowe
../obama_wave/O11_163.wav|save a speech about the economy and to his credit
../obama_wave/O11_164.wav|he made the point that we can't afford the cat
../obama_wave/O11_165.wav|text that says it's my way or the Highway
../obama_wave/O11_166.wav|I was encouraged by that
../obama_wave/O11_167.wav|here's the problem in the same speech
../obama_wave/O11_168.wav|any plan to cut the deficit
../obama_wave/O11_169.wav|include any additional revenues whatsoever
../obama_wave/O11_17.wav|spell knowing that every proposal is
../obama_wave/O11_170.wav|he said I'm
../obama_wave/O11_171.wav|there is only one
../obama_wave/O11_172.wav|and that opt
../obama_wave/O11_173.wav|and only option relies entire
../obama_wave/O11_174.wav|some cats that means slashing education
../obama_wave/O11_175.wav|ring the research necessary to keep
../obama_wave/O11_176.wav|technological Edge in the 21st century
../obama_wave/O11_177.wav|and allowing our critical public assets like Highway
../obama_wave/O11_178.wav|Bridges and airports to get worse
../obama_wave/O11_179.wav|it would cripple our competitiveness and our ability
../obama_wave/O11_18.wav|only paid for the American jobs
../obama_wave/O11_180.wav|the jobs of the future and what also
../obama_wave/O11_181.wav|I'm asking sacrifice of seniors and
../obama_wave/O11_182.wav|class and the poor while asking nothing
../obama_wave/O11_183.wav|the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations
../obama_wave/O11_184.wav|so the speaker
../obama_wave/O11_185.wav|we can't have it my way
../obama_wave/O11_186.wav|should I wear and then basically says my way
../obama_wave/O11_187.wav|for the highway
../obama_wave/O11_189.wav|it's not smart it's not
../obama_wave/O11_19.wav|will not add to our Nation's debt
../obama_wave/O11_190.wav|if we're going to meet
../obama_wave/O11_191.wav|responsibilities we have to do it together
../obama_wave/O11_192.wav|now I'm proposing real
../obama_wave/O11_195.wav|this would be among the biggest cuts in spending in our
../obama_wave/O11_197.wav|a plan that asks the most ft
../obama_wave/O11_198.wav|to pay their fair share just like everybody
../obama_wave/O11_20.wav|play I'm releasing a plan the details how to pay
../obama_wave/O11_200.wav|that's why this plant eliminates tax Lo
../obama_wave/O11_201.wav|primarily go to the wealthiest taxpayers
../obama_wave/O11_202.wav|corporations tax breaks
../obama_wave/O11_203.wav|call businesses in middle class families don't get
../obama_wave/O11_205.wav|if tax reform doesn't get done
../obama_wave/O11_206.wav|plan ask the wealthiest Americans to go back to paying
../obama_wave/O11_207.wav|name rights that they paid during the 1990s before the bush
../obama_wave/O11_209.wav|it's not because anybody looks forward to the prospects
../obama_wave/O11_21.wav|the jobs bill while also paying
../obama_wave/O11_211.wav|in fact I've
../obama_wave/O11_212.wav|taxes for the middle class and for small businesses and through the
../obama_wave/O11_214.wav|more money in the pockets of people but we can't
../obama_wave/O11_215.wav|the special lower rates for the wealthy
../obama_wave/O11_216.wav|rates by the way that were meant to be temporary
../obama_wave/O11_217.wav|back when these first these tax cut
../obama_wave/O11_218.wav|back in 2001 2003 were being talked
../obama_wave/O11_219.wav|temporary measures
../obama_wave/O11_22.wav|our debt overtime
../obama_wave/O11_220.wav|we can't afford them when we're running these big deaths
../obama_wave/O11_221.wav|now I
../obama_wave/O11_222.wav|so ready to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform
../obama_wave/O11_223.wav|to get rid of the
../obama_wave/O11_224.wav|of accumulated loopholes special interest
../obama_wave/O11_225.wav|what about another tax expenditures that stack
../obama_wave/O11_226.wav|small business owners and ordinary families Who
../obama_wave/O11_227.wav|Ford Washington lobbyist or fancy accounts
../obama_wave/O11_228.wav|are tax code is more than 10000
../obama_wave/O11_229.wav|if you stack up
../obama_wave/O11_23.wav|because the health of our economy
../obama_wave/O11_230.wav|volumes they're almost 5 feet tall
../obama_wave/O11_231.wav|that means that how
../obama_wave/O11_232.wav|could you play often depends less on what you make
../obama_wave/O11_233.wav|more on how well you can game the
../obama_wave/O11_234.wav|and that's especially true
../obama_wave/O11_235.wav|corporate tax code we've got one of the highest corporate tax are
../obama_wave/O11_236.wav|world but it's riddled with exceptions
../obama_wave/O11_237.wav|special interest loopholes so some
../obama_wave/O11_238.wav|get up paying a lot of taxes while the rest of
../obama_wave/O11_239.wav|have end up having to put the bill
../obama_wave/O11_24.wav|in part on what we do
../obama_wave/O11_240.wav|and this makes our entire economy less competitive
../obama_wave/O11_241.wav|and our country a less zyro place to do
../obama_wave/O11_242.wav|that has to change
../obama_wave/O11_243.wav|are tax code shouldn't give an advantage to companies with
../obama_wave/O11_245.wav|in the United States of America and create jobs in the
../obama_wave/O11_246.wav|what states of America and we can lower the corporate rate if we
../obama_wave/O11_247.wav|rid of all the special deals
../obama_wave/O11_248.wav|so I am ready I'm eag

../obama_wave/O11_58.wav|or prevent us from helping small businesses
../obama_wave/O11_59.wav|rental class families get back on their feet
../obama_wave/O11_6.wav|for veterans and for the unemployed
../obama_wave/O11_60.wav|does an approach that said we need to go through the budget
../obama_wave/O11_61.wav|line looking for waste without
../obama_wave/O11_62.wav|changing education and basic SC
../obama_wave/O11_63.wav|research and road construction
../obama_wave/O11_64.wav|because those things are essential to our future
../obama_wave/O11_65.wav|Anna was an approach that said we shouldn't

../obama_wave/O11_68.wav|including the wealthiest

../obama_wave/O12_392.wav|you can be

../obama_wave/O12_397.wav|a never forget that
../obama_wave/O12_398.wav|most important example of young girl will ever follow

../obama_wave/O12_40.wav|Meryl Streep
../obama_wave/O12_400.wav|million Sasha are going to be outstanding
../obama_wave/O12_401.wav|because Michelle and
../obama_wave/O12_402.wav|Marian Robinson are outstanding one so
../obama_wave/O12_405.wav|my last piece of advice this is simple

../obama_wave/O12_412.wav|but they keep at it
../obama_wave/O12_413.wav|they learn from
../obama_wave/O12_414.wav|they don't quit
../obama_wave/O12_415.wav|you know when I first arrived on this campus it
../obama_wave/O12_416.wav|fewer options
../obama_wave/O12_417.wav|but it was here that I tried
../obama_wave/O12_418.wav|find my place in this world I knew I want to
../obama_wave/O12_42.wav|power but
../obama_wave/O12_422.wav|how to do my part to shape
../obama_wave/O12_423.wav|a Better World so even as I worked
../obama_wave/O12_424.wav|after graduation in a few unfulfilling jobs here in
../obama_wave/O12_425.wav|even
../obama_wave/O12_426.wav|went from

../obama_wave/O12_433.wav|neighbourhoods hit hard by Steel Mills that were shutting down
../obama_wave/O12_434.wav|and and communities where jobs were
../obama_wave/O12_435.wav|dying away
../obama_wave/O12_436.wav|the community had been played by gang violence so
../obama_wave/O12_438.wav|a meeting with community leaders to deal with gangs
../obama_wave/O12_439.wav|then I'd worked for weeks on this project we invited
../obama_wave/O12_44.wav|find a secretaries of state America's ever had
../obama_wave/O12_441.wav|the night of the meeting we arranged Rose and
../obama_wave/O12_444.wav|and finally a group of
../obama_wave/O12_446.wav|is this where the bingo
../obama_wave/O12_449.wav|it was a disaster
../obama_wave/O12_451.wav|nobody showed up
../obama_wave/O12_452.wav|and later the Volante
../obama_wave/O12_453.wav|worked with tell me that's it
../obama_wave/O12_454.wav|they've been doing this for 2 years even before
../obama_wave/O12_455.wav|there's nothing to show for it and I'll be honest
../obama_wave/O12_456.wav|property describes as well I didn't know what I was doing I thought about
../obama_wave/O12_457.wav|as we were talking I looked
../obama_wave/O12_458.wav|I saw some young boys playing
../obama_wave/O12_46.wav|we gave Merrill the presidential

../obama_wave/O12_463.wav|what will happen to

../obama_wave/O12_466.wav|who will give them a
../obama_wave/O12_467.wav|if we leave
../obama_wave/O12_468.wav|and one by one the volunteers decided
../obama_wave/O12_469.wav|went back to those neighbourhood
../obama_wave/O12_47.wav|of Arts and humanities
../obama_wave/O12_471.wav|programs we fought for new jobs
../obama_wave/O12_472.wav|help people live lives with some measure of
../obama_wave/O12_473.wav|we sustain ourselves
../obama_wave/O12_474.wav|with those small victories we didn't set the world on fire
../obama_wave/O12_475.wav|some of those Communities are still very poor
../obama_wave/O12_476.wav|we're still a lot of gangs out there
../obama_wave/O12_477.wav|but I believe that it was no small victories
../obama_wave/O12_478.wav|me when the bigger victories of my
../obama_wave/O12_479.wav|last 3 1/2 years as president
../obama_wave/O12_48.wav|Cheryl is not just
../obama_wave/O12_480.wav|and I wish I could say that this
../obama_wave/O12_481.wav|parents came from some in a toughness in me
../obama_wave/O12_482.wav|the truth is it was learnt
../obama_wave/O12_483.wav|I got it from watching the people who raised me
../obama_wave/O12_484.wav|more specifically I got it from watching the
../obama_wave/O12_485.wav|who shaved my life
../obama_wave/O12_487.wav|I grew up as the son of a single mom who struggled
../obama_wave/O12_488.wav|after school and make ends meet
../obama_wave/O12_489.wav|she had marriages that fell apart

../obama_wave/O12_515.wav|later on
../obama_wave/O12_516.wav|woman who was assigned to advise me on my first

../obama_wave/O12_531.wav|we made that marriage work
../obama_wave/O12_532.wav|and the reason Michelle had the strength to juggle

../obama_wave/O13_784.wav|and the good news is it the many nations
../obama_wave/O13_785.wav|what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitment
../obama_wave/O13_786.wav|consider what we've accomplished here
../obama_wave/O13_787.wav|over the past few years
../obama_wave/O13_788.wav|together we mobilise some
../obama_wave/O13_789.wav|thousand additional troops for UN peacekeeping

../obama_wave/O13_832.wav|let me conclude by saying that

../obama_wave/O13_850.wav|can you repeat them cycles of conflict and suffering
../obama_wave/O13_852.wav|perhaps that's our feet

../obama_wave/O14_473.wav|and when disease goes unchecked in any

../obama_wave/O14_495.wav|but from human beings
../obama_wave/O14_496.wav|so the final area that I will address is conflict
../obama_wave/O14_497.wav|let me be clear
../obama_wave/O14_498.wav|Africa is not the crude Carrick
../obama_wave/O14_5.wav|I like this
../obama_wave/O14_50.wav|in Accra as well

../obama_wave/O14_502.wav|is a part of life is
../obama_wave/O14_503.wav|what is this song There
../obama_wave/O14_504.wav|overland and Wars over resources

../obama_wave/O14_506.wav|for those without conscience to manipulate hole
../obama_wave/O14_508.wav|these conflicts are a mill
../obama_wave/O14_509.wav|around Africa's neck
../obama_wave/O14_510.wav|we all have many identities of tribe and eth

../obama_wave/O14_513.wav|who worships a different prop
../obama_wave/O14_514.wav|has no place in the 21st century
../obama_wave/O14_517.wav|Africa's diversity should be a source of strength

../obama_wave/O14_54.wav|this is the simple truth

../obama_wave/O15_240.wav|we've often accepted more income inequality than

../obama_wave/O15_247.wav|on Capital we do wish to allow the
../obama_wave/O15_25.wav|the center which I've been

../obama_wave/O15_253.wav|a child born in the top 20
../obama_wave/O15_254.wav|how's about

../obama_wave/O15_264.wav|today for a child born here in America

../obama_wave/O15_266.wav|children in most of our wealthy Alice countries
../obama_wave/O15_271.wav|nation on Earth is heartbreaking enough
../obama_wave/O15_272.wav|but the idea that
../obama_wave/O15_273.wav|a child may never be able to escape that poverty
../obama_wave/O15_274.wav|relax a decent education or health care
../obama_wave/O15_275.wav|where community the views per future

../obama_wave/O15_280.wav|trends of increased inequality
../obama_wave/O15_283.wav|around the globe
../obama_wave/O15_284.wav|and it is not simply a moral claim that I'm making
../obama_wave/O15_285.wav|there are practical consequences
../obama_wave/O15_288.wav|135
../obama_wave/O15_289.wav|growth is more fragile and recessions are more

../obama_wave/O15_307.wav|and greater inequality is associated with
../obama_wave/O15_31.wav|which means that you're

../obama_wave/O15_320.wav|ordinary folks can't write mass

../obama_wave/O15_336.wav|Washington consistently fail to act
../obama_wave/O15_338.wav|I think a big reason
../obama_wave/O15_339.wav|is the mess that have developed around the issue of inequal

../obama_wave/O15_341.wav|first there's the myth that this

../obama_wave/O15_349.wav|far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity
../obama_wave/O15_35.wav|that runs through our history

../obama_wave/O15_5.wav|well thank you nearer for the wonderful
../obama_wave/O15_50.wav|but we know the People's frustrations run deep

../obama_wave/O15_503.wav|if the economic pie is shrinking or stag
../obama_wave/O15_504.wav|the fact is

../obama_wave/O15_508.wav|when's the Spurs private sector investment
../obama_wave/O15_509.wav|and that's why from day one
../obama_wave/O15_51.wav|then these most recent political battles
../obama_wave/O15_511.wav|and thanks to their resilience
../obama_wave/O15_513.wav|and now we've got to grow the economy
../obama_wave/O15_517.wav|energy and infrastructure and technology

../obama_wave/O15_519.wav|corporate tax code in a way that closes wasteful loopholes

../obama_wave/O15_536.wav|and then

../obama_wave/O15_552.wav|repeat in a highly competitive global account
../obama_wave/O15_553.wav|we know that education is
../obama_wave/O15_554.wav|most important predictor of income today
../obama_wave/O15_555.wav|so we launched a race to the top
../obama_wave/O15_556.wav|schools were supporting states that have raised standard

../obama_wave/O15_563.wav|students go to college with grants and loans
../obama_wave/O15_564.wav|farther than before we've made it more
../obama_wave/O15_565.wav|today more students are
../obama_wave/O15_567.wav|we're also pursuing an aggressive strategy to promote
../obama_wave/O15_568.wav|salvation that rains in tuition cost
../obama_wave/O15_569.wav|you've got a lower cost
../obama_wave/O15_570.wav|young people are not burdened by enormous debt

../obama_wave/O15_705.wav|and if we give more cities the tools to do it
../obama_wave/O15_708.wav|few weeks will announce the first of these

../obama_wave/O15_741.wav|for future generations and remember
../obama_wave/O15_742.wav|these are promises we make to one another we don't do

../obama_wave/O15_762.wav|tell more than 1 million of these Americans that they have
../obama_wave/O15_763.wav|unemployment insurance which is what will happen
../obama_wave/O15_767.wav|the point is this

../obama_wave/O15_773.wav|retrain themselves for the jobs
../obama_wave/O15_778.wav|century economy for example we should
../obama_wave/O15_779.wav|willing to look at fresh ideas to revamp

../obama_wave/O15_79.wav|can someone ask why
../obama_wave/O15_790.wav|but understand that these programs of social
../obama_wave/O15_793.wav|we don't know when we might lose
../obama_wave/O15_795.wav|of course for decades there was
../obama_wave/O15_797.wav|expose working families to the insecurities
../obama_wave/O15_799.wav|that's why we fought
../obama_wave/O15_8.wav|in my life and probably resonated with some of you
../obama_wave/O15_80.wav|the issue again right now
../obama_wave/O15_804.wav|because
../obama_wave/O15_805.wav|thousand Americans lost their health insurance
../obama_wave/O15_807.wav|because they didn't have health insurance at all
../obama_wave/O15_808.wav|we did it because millions of

../obama_wave/O15_848.wav|I need to succeed in the future

../obama_wave/O15_855.wav|and good for the budgets of businesses

../obama_wave/O15_86.wav|visions we make on these issues over the next few years will
../obama_wave/O15_860.wav|and as people in States
../obama_wave/O15_861.wav|California and Kentucky sign up
../obama_wave/O15_862.wav|health insurance signing up in droves
../obama_wave/O15_863.wav|they're proving they want that economic security

../obama_wave/O15_873.wav|let me in my addressing the elephant in the room here
../obama_wave/O15_874.wav|which is the seeming inability to
../obama_wave/O15_875.wav|anything done in Washington these days
../obama_wave/O15_877.wav|why is we are not going to resolve all of our political
../obama_wave/O15_878.wav|lights over the best ways to reduce inequality
../obama_wave/O15_879.wav|mobility
../obama_wave/O15_880.wav|this year or next year
../obama_wave/O15_881.wav|on the next 5 years
../obama_wave/O15_882.wav|but it is important that we have a
../obama_wave/O15_883.wav|debate about these issues
../obama_wave/O15_884.wav|for the longer
../obama_wave/O15_886.wav|cynicism and fear that many Americans are feeling right now
../obama_wave/O15_887.wav|that will never be able to repay the
../obama_wave/O15_888.wav|play took on to go to college they'll never be able to
../obama_wave/O15_890.wav|children land a good job that supports a family
../obama_wave/O15_891.wav|and that's why even
../obama_wave/O15_892.wav|play we'll keep on offering my own ideas

../obama_wave/O15_9.wav|in over the past

../obama_wave/O15_917.wav|that way we can have a

../obama_wave/O15_921.wav|it's not enough anymore to just say we

../obama_wave/O17_451.wav|we are taking concrete a

../obama_wave/O17_501.wav|on the other hand
../obama_wave/O17_502.wav|is also undeniable that the Palestinian people
../obama_wave/O17_503.wav|Muslims and Christians
../obama_wave/O17_504.wav|has suffered
../obama_wave/O17_506.wav|more than 60 years they've endured the pain of

../obama_wave/O17_528.wav|it's easy to point fingers
../obama_wave/O17_529.wav|Palestinians to point to the displacement brought

../obama_wave/O17_535.wav|play from one side or the other
../obama_wave/O17_536.wav|then we will be blind to the truth
../obama_wave/O17_537.wav|the only resolution is for the

../obama_wave/O17_697.wav|a hugely dangerous path
../obama_wave/O17_698.wav|I understand

../obama_wave/O17_747.wav|we will support them everywhere
../obama_wave/O17_75.wav|and share common principles
../obama_wave/O17_751.wav|now there is no straight line

../obama_wave/O17_796.wav|sound as a child in Indonesia where
../obama_wave/O17_797.wav|Christians worship freely in an overwhelming
../obama_wave/O17_798.wav|Muslim country
../obama_wave/O17_8.wav|2 remarkable institutions
../obama_wave/O17_80.wav|the change cannot happen overnight
../obama_wave/O17_800.wav|people in every country should be free to choose

../obama_wave/O17_804.wav|cancel for religion to thrive
../obama_wave/O17_805.wav|but it's being challenged in
../obama_wave/O17_806.wav|different ways
../obama_wave/O17_807.wav|among some Muslims there's a disturbing tendency to measure
../obama_wave/O17_808.wav|zone faith by the rejection of somebody
../obama_wave/O17_81.wav|I know there's been a lot of publicity about this speech
../obama_wave/O17_810.wav|the richness of religious diversity
../obama_wave/O17_811.wav|whether it is for

../obama_wave/O17_823.wav|always examine the ways in which we protect it
../obama_wave/O17_824.wav|for instance in the United States rules
../obama_wave/O17_825.wav|charitable giving have made it harder for
../obama_wave/O17_826.wav|to fulfill the religious obligation
../obama_wave/O17_827.wav|that's why I'm committed to working with
../obama_wave/O17_828.wav|American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill
../obama_wave/O17_83.wav|nor can I
../obama_wave/O17_830.wav|why it is important for Western

../obama_wave/O17_85.wav|all the complex questions that brought us to this

../obama_wave/O17_852.wav|I know
../obama_wave/O17_854.wav|I know and you can tell from this AUD
../obama_wave/O17_855.wav|weather is a healthy debate about this issue
../obama_wave/O17_856.wav|I reject the
../obama_wave/O17_859.wav|I do believe that a woman who is denied an education
../obama_wave/O17_86.wav|but I am Khan
../obama_wave/O17_860.wav|is denied equality
../obama_wave/O17_863.wav|and it is no coincidence that countries
../obama_wave/O17_864.wav|women are well educated
../obama_wave/O17_865.wav|more likely to be prosperous
../obama_wave/O17_866.wav|now let me be clear issues
../obama_wave/O17_867.wav|what does a quality are by no means simply an issue for is
../obama_wave/O17_868.wav|in Turkey Pakistan
../obama_wave/O17_869.wav|Bangladesh Indonesia
../obama_wave/O17_87.wav|that in order to move forward
../obama_wave/O17_870.wav|we've seen Muslim majority countries elect
../obama_wave/O17_872.wav|how the Struggle for women's equality continues in
../obama_wave/O17_873.wav|aspects of American life and in countries
../obama_wave/O17_875.wav|I am convinced that
../obama_wave/O17_876.wav|contribute just as much to society

../obama_wave/O17_888.wav|their choice
../obama_wave/O17_889.wav|that is why the United States will partner

../obama_wave/O17_892.wav|employment through microfinancing that helps people

../obama_wave/O18_309.wav|pause or properly accounted for
../obama_wave/O18_31.wav|I also
../obama_wave/O18_310.wav|that's the kind of partnership of America offers

../obama_wave/O18_313.wav|ending the Cancer of corruption
../obama_wave/O18_314.wav|and you are right that it is not just

../obama_wave/O18_316.wav|business with Africa it is not unique
../obama_wave/O18_317.wav|Africa corruption exists all over the world in
../obama_wave/O18_318.wav|sing in the United States
../obama_wave/O18_319.wav|but here in Africa corruption drains billions of dollar

../obama_wave/O18_322.wav|create jobs and build hospitals and schools
../obama_wave/O18_323.wav|and when someone has to pay

../obama_wave/O18_334.wav|and promote good governance and transparency
../obama_wave/O18_335.wav|and we already have strong laws in place
../obama_wave/O18_336.wav|let's say the US company you can't
../obama_wave/O18_337.wav|engage in bribery to try to get business
../obama_wave/O18_338.wav|which nada all countries have

../obama_wave/O18_348.wav|to the old ways of doing things
../obama_wave/O18_349.wav|is this new generation of African youth
../obama_wave/O18_35.wav|help to shape America

../obama_wave/O18_354.wav|you see in this information age jobs can
../obama_wave/O18_355.wav|anyway and they typically
../obama_wave/O18_356.wav|flow to where workers are literate and

../obama_wave/O18_36.wav|and allowed it to be

../obama_wave/O18_521.wav|freedoms to

../obama_wave/O18_526.wav|even when it's sometimes directed towards
../obama_wave/O18_527.wav|and I know that there's some countries
../obama_wave/O18_528.wav|don't say anything and
../obama_wave/O18_529.wav|play that's easier to for liters

../obama_wave/O18_533.wav|I want to repeat we
../obama_wave/O18_534.wav|that's not because we think our democracy is perfect or we
../obama_wave/O18_535.wav|set every country has to follow precisely our
../obama_wave/O18_536.wav|for more than two centuries since our independence we're
../obama_wave/O18_537.wav|we're not immune
../obama_wave/O18_539.wav|when
../obama_wave/O18_540.wav|but when we speak out for
../obama_wave/O18_541.wav|at home and Abroad
../obama_wave/O18_542.wav|we straight stay true to our values and we
../obama_wave/O18_543.wav|lift up the lives of people beyond our boards and we think that's important
../obama_wave/O18_545.wav|any especially important I believe
../obama_wave/O18_546.wav|for those of us African descent because
../obama_wave/O18_547.wav|What It Feels Like to be on the
../obama_wave/O18_548.wav|sing Avengers we know what
../obama_wave/O18_549.wav|used to be discriminated against we know what it means to be
../obama_wave/O18_55.wav|lower them in that small cell on
../obama_wave/O18_551.wav|so how can we stand by
../obama_wave/O18_552.wav|when it's happening to somebody else
../obama_wave/O18_553.wav|I'll be frank with you can't just be America
../obama_wave/O18_555.wav|talk about these things
../obama_wave/O18_557.wav|Colonial
../obama_wave/O18_558.wav|our
../obama_wave/O18_559.wav|must all raise our voices when universal rights
../obama_wave/O18_560.wav|for if we truly believe that
../obama_wave/O18_561.wav|what bands are equal indignant
../obama_wave/O18_562.wav|the Africans have an equal right to freedoms that
../obama_wave/O18_564.wav|and it's not just a Western idea
../obama_wave/O18_565.wav|it's a human idea
../obama_wave/O18_567.wav|also say that
../obama_wave/O18_568.wav|Africa's democratic progress is also at risk when
../obama_wave/O18_569.wav|leaders refuse to set aside when
../obama_wave/O18_573.wav|no
../obama_wave/O18_574.wav|let me be honest with you I do not understand
../obama_wave/O18_575.wav|yes
../obama_wave/O18_577.wav|I am in my second term
../obama_wave/O18_578.wav|it has been an extraordinary
../obama_wave/O18_579.wav|for me to serve as president United States
../obama_wave/O18_580.wav|I cannot imagine a greater honour or
../obama_wave/O18_581.wav|interesting job
../obama_wave/O18_582.wav|I love my work
../obama_wave/O18_583.wav|but under our constitution I cannot
../obama_wave/O18_586.wav|I actually think I'm
../obama_wave/O18_588.wav|but I can't
../obama_wave/O18_591.wav|so there's a lot that I'd like to
../obama_wave/O18_592.wav|keep America moving but
../obama_wave/O18_593.wav|pause the alarm
../obama_wave/O18_594.wav|and
../obama_wave/O18_595.wav|person is above the law not even the president
../obama_wave/O18_598.wav|and I'll be I'll be honest with you I'm looking
../obama_wave/O18_599.wav|what's the life after being president
../obama_wave/O18_6.wav|can your leadership to
../obama_wave/O18_600.wav|I won't have such a big security detail
../obama_wave/O18_601.wav|it means I can go take a walk
../obama_wave/O18_602.wav|I can spend time with my family I can
../obama_wave/O18_603.wav|other ways to serve I can visit
../obama_wave/O18_606.wav|the point is I don't
../obama_wave/O18_609.wav|especially when they've got a lot of money
../obama_wave/O18_61.wav|for us
../obama_wave/O18_615.wav|when a leader tries to change
../obama_wave/O18_616.wav|rules in the middle of the game just to stay in office
../obama_wave/O18_617.wav|it risks instability
../obama_wave/O18_619.wav|and this is
../obama_wave/O18_62.wav|for children Africa
../obama_wave/O18_620.wav|and this is of
../obama_wave/O18_621.wav|what's the first step down a perilous path
../obama_wave/O18_622.wav|and sometimes you'll hear a leader say well
../obama_wave/O18_623.wav|the only person who can hold this nation together
../obama_wave/O18_624.wav|if that's true
../obama_wave/O18_625.wav|where is failed to truly build their nation

../obama_wave/O19_322.wav|isolationism that's a false comfort
../obama_wave/O19_323.wav|allowing problems to Fester over
../obama_wave/O19_324.wav|makes us less secure here
../obama_wave/O19_325.wav|As Americans we have to keep leading and working
../obama_wave/O19_326.wav|security and prosperity
../obama_wave/O19_327.wav|and justice we want in the world
../obama_wave/O19_329.wav|what are the most effective ways to lead and work with others is
../obama_wave/O19_33.wav|he's not here today I
../obama_wave/O19_331.wav|mindset in congress
../obama_wave/O19_332.wav|just about any international treaty is somehow
../obama_wave/O19_333.wav|the violation of American sovereignty and so the Senate
../obama_wave/O19_338.wav|in a wheelchair
../obama_wave/O19_339.wav|we don't always realise that but treaties help make
../obama_wave/O19_34.wav|how do I have nominate another Academy graduate and
../obama_wave/O19_340.wav|a lot of things in our lives possible that we take for granted from
../obama_wave/O19_342.wav|those are good things those are not a threat to
../obama_wave/O19_344.wav|I think we can all agree on that
../obama_wave/O19_345.wav|but also from NATO
../obama_wave/O19_346.wav|treat
../obama_wave/O19_347.wav|controlling nuclear weapons treaties help Keep Us safe
../obama_wave/O19_348.wav|so if we're truly concerned about
../obama_wave/O19_349.wav|actions in the South China Sea for example the
../obama_wave/O19_350.wav|help strengthen our case by proving the law of the
../obama_wave/O19_352.wav|and by the way these trees are not a new thing
../obama_wave/O19_353.wav|the power to make treaties is written into
../obama_wave/O19_355.wav|it's time for the Senate to do its job and help us advance
../obama_wave/O19_359.wav|a part of the reason it's so important is because the
../obama_wave/O19_36.wav|Air Force Chief of staff general David
../obama_wave/O19_360.wav|States remains the one in disputable nation in world
../obama_wave/O19_361.wav|I say this all the time after 8 years I have
../obama_wave/O19_362.wav|on to an international conference summit meeting
../obama_wave/O19_363.wav|where we were not

../obama_wave/O19_369.wav|I'm just about every issue the world looks to us to
../obama_wave/O19_37.wav|golfing

../obama_wave/O19_371.wav|call Beijing or Moscow they call
../obama_wave/O19_373.wav|and we lead not by dictating
../obama_wave/O19_375.wav|by treating other countries and their people
../obama_wave/O19_377.wav|Now by lottery
../obama_wave/O19_380.wav|more likely to work with us and ultimately it makes us
../obama_wave/O19_381.wav|so we need
../obama_wave/O19_382.wav|American leadership
../obama_wave/O19_383.wav|and part of leading wisely
../obama_wave/O19_385.wav|remember

../obama_wave/O21_142.wav|does it matter of national Security
../obama_wave/O21_143.wav|we also need to make it harder for people to buy

../obama_wave/O21_153.wav|to kill

../obama_wave/O22_148.wav|I approved a proposal to consider new

../obama_wave/O22_158.wav|deserve to know why

../obama_wave/O22_200.wav|how much we improve our regulation of the industry

../obama_wave/O22_26.wav|our Nation's secretary of energy
../obama_wave/O22_260.wav|I laid out a set of principles that would move our country

../obama_wave/O22_266.wav|now there are costs associated with this transition
../obama_wave/O22_267.wav|and there's some who believe that we can't a

../obama_wave/O22_269.wav|can't afford not to change how we prod
../obama_wave/O22_27.wav|scientists or national Labs and experts from academ

../obama_wave/O22_276.wav|efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars
../obama_wave/O22_277.wav|some believe we should set standards to en
../obama_wave/O22_278.wav|more of our electricity comes from wind and solar
../obama_wave/O22_279.wav|others wonder why the energy

../obama_wave/O22_282.wav|such research and development all
../obama_wave/O22_283.wav|things approaches have merit and deserves a fair hearing in the
../obama_wave/O22_284.wav|but the one approach I will not
../obama_wave/O22_286.wav|will not settle for is the idea that this challenge
../obama_wave/O22_287.wav|how too big and too difficult to meet
../obama_wave/O22_288.wav|you know the same thing was

../obama_wave/O22_29.wav|and advice as a result of

../obama_wave/O26_428.wav|teacher jobs made sure that schools didn't
../obama_wave/O26_429.wav|cut back even more drastically and every community across
../obama_wave/O26_43.wav|making our Union just a little more perfect
../obama_wave/O26_430.wav|but I think the sing
../obama_wave/O26_432.wav|initiative called race to the top
../obama_wave/O26_433.wav|we said
../obama_wave/O26_435.wav|the outstanding teaching
../obama_wave/O26_436.wav|to successful schools to hire stand
../obama_wave/O26_437.wav|the better assessments
../obama_wave/O26_438.wav|if you're a committed to excellence for all children
../obama_wave/O26_439.wav|you will be eligible for a grant

../obama_wave/O26_442.wav|sing and they have been Powerful
../obama_wave/O26_443.wav|in an effort to compete for this extra money
../obama_wave/O26_444.wav|two States reformed their educ
../obama_wave/O26_445.wav|pause before we even spend a die
../obama_wave/O26_446.wav|the competition leverage change
../obama_wave/O26_449.wav|only a couple of states actually won the
../obama_wave/O26_45.wav|have there been late and I'm grateful
../obama_wave/O26_450.wav|in the first round which meant that the
../obama_wave/O26_452.wav|made additional reforms
../obama_wave/O26_453.wav|now 36 have applied in the second
../obama_wave/O26_454.wav|in 18 States Plus

../obama_wave/O26_457.wav|so understand what's happening in each success
../obama_wave/O26_458.wav|sound with leverage change across
../obama_wave/O26_459.wav|and even students
../obama_wave/O26_46.wav|put outstanding contributions that you

../obama_wave/O26_469.wav|for the most part States educat
../obama_wave/O26_470.wav|they responded with great Enthusiasm around
../obama_wave/O26_472.wav|controversy about race to the top
../obama_wave/O26_473.wav|part of it I believe reflects a
../obama_wave/O26_474.wav|resistance to change we
../obama_wave/O26_475.wav|comfortable with the status Quo even when the status Quo isn't good
../obama_wave/O26_477.wav|we make excuses for why things
../obama_wave/O26_478.wav|give me the way there and when you
../obama_wave/O26_479.wav|shake things up some people
../obama_wave/O26_48.wav|the last time I spoke
../obama_wave/O26_480.wav|aren't happy
../obama_wave/O26_481.wav|there been criticisms
../obama_wave/O26_483.wav|about particular elements of race
../obama_wave/O26_485.wav|conversation
../obama_wave/O26_487.wav|doesn't do enough for min
../obama_wave/O26_488.wav|because the argument
../obama_wave/O26_489.wav|tell if there's a competition then
../obama_wave/O26_49.wav|I was doing
../obama_wave/O26_490.wav|somehow
../obama_wave/O26_491.wav|some States or some school districts will get more help than
../obama_wave/O26_492.wav|let me tell you what's
../obama_wave/O26_493.wav|black kids and hispanic kids and
../obama_wave/O26_494.wav|American kids across this country is the status
../obama_wave/O26_495.wav|that's what's not working
../obama_wave/O26_496.wav|what's not working is what we
../obama_wave/O26_497.wav|for decades now
../obama_wave/O26_498.wav|so the charge that
../obama_wave/O26_5.wav|the Urban League movement to welcome the
../obama_wave/O26_50.wav|your Orlando conference
../obama_wave/O26_500.wav|need is absolutely false because
../obama_wave/O26_501.wav|lifting up quality for all our children
../obama_wave/O26_502.wav|black white hispanic that is the central
../obama_wave/O26_503.wav|what time is the rest of the top and
../obama_wave/O26_505.wav|schools that are failing in those young people who aren't doing well
../obama_wave/O26_506.wav|every state in every school
../obama_wave/O26_507.wav|is directly incentivized
../obama_wave/O26_508.wav|what schools that have been forgotten been given
../obama_wave/O26_51.wav|in August
../obama_wave/O26_510.wav|I also want to directly speak to the issue of teachers
../obama_wave/O26_511.wav|we may have some teachers here in the house
../obama_wave/O26_512.wav|I know Urban
../obama_wave/O26_513.wav|play some teachers
../obama_wave/O26_514.wav|nothing is more important than teachers
../obama_wave/O26_515.wav|my sister is a teacher
../obama_wave/O26_516.wav|I'm here because of great teachers
../obama_wave/O26_517.wav|the whole premise of race to the
../obama_wave/O26_518.wav|is the teachers are the single most important
../obama_wave/O26_519.wav|in a child's education from the moment they step into the
../obama_wave/O26_52.wav|Orlando in the house
../obama_wave/O26_520.wav|and I know
../obama_wave/O26_522.wav|did the vast majority of teachers are working
../obama_wave/O26_523.wav|are passionate about their students
../obama_wave/O26_524.wav|digging into their own pockets for basic
../obama_wave/O26_525.wav|are going above and beyond the call of dut
../obama_wave/O26_526.wav|so I want
../obama_wave/O26_527.wav|I want them to have
../obama_wave/O26_528.wav|support I want them to be trained like
../obama_wave/O26_529.wav|professionals they are with rig
../obama_wave/O26_53.wav|Orlando conference
../obama_wave/O26_531.wav|I want to give them a queer ladder so
../obama_wave/O26_533.wav|financial security I don't want talented young people to say I'd love
../obama_wave/O26_534.wav|teach but I can't afford it
../obama_wave/O26_536.wav|time to have a fulfilling and supportive
../obama_wave/O26_537.wav|play some Bon
../obama_wave/O26_538.wav|I want them out the resources from Basic
../obama_wave/O26_539.wav|best reasonable class sizes that help them succeed
../obama_wave/O26_54.wav|August of 2008
../obama_wave/O26_540.wav|and instead of a culture where we're always
../obama_wave/O26_541.wav|analysing sports stars or celebrities I want
../obama_wave/O26_542.wav|spell the culture where we idolise the people who are
../obama_wave/O26_543.wav|children's future
../obama_wave/O26_544.wav|I want some
../obama_wave/O26_545.wav|is on the covers of some of those magazines
../obama_wave/O26_546.wav|some teachers on
../obama_wave/O26_547.wav|TV feature
../obama_wave/O26_550.wav|yesterday and
../obama_wave/O26_551.wav|somebody asked me
../obama_wave/O26_554.wav|I know some really good teachers that you guys should be
../obama_wave/O26_555.wav|I didn't say the teacher part
../obama_wave/O26_557.wav|question is who
../obama_wave/O26_558.wav|Who
../obama_wave/O26_561.wav|110%
../obama_wave/O26_562.wav|behind our teachers
../obama_wave/O26_563.wav|but all
../obama_wave/O26_566.wav|as a parent and as a citizen
../obama_wave/O26_567.wav|is a measure of accountability
../obama_wave/O26_568.wav|so
../obama_wave/O26_569.wav|even
../obama_wave/O26_570.wav|teachers for their hard work
../obama_wave/O26_571.wav|we've got to make sure that
../obama_wave/O26_572.wav|seeing results in the classroom
../obama_wave/O26_573.wav|if if we're not
../obama_wave/O26_574.wav|salt in the classroom then let's work with teachers to help them
../obama_wave/O26_575.wav|become more effective
../obama_wave/O26_576.wav|if that doesn't work let's find the right
../obama_wave/O26_577.wav|before that classroom
../obama_wave/O26_58.wav|says alright
../obama_wave/O26_580.wav|are children get
../obama_wave/O26_581.wav|one chance at an education so
../obama_wave/O26_582.wav|do you get it right
../obama_wave/O26_583.wav|I want to commend some of the
../obama_wave/O26_584.wav|unions across this country who are working with
../obama_wave/O26_585.wav|what's the improve teacher like the
../obama_wave/O26_586.wav|educational Association which is working with state
../obama_wave/O26_588.wav|tell me to set aside 90 minutes of collaboration
../obama_wave/O26_589.wav|teach
../obama_wave/O26_590.wav|element and evaluation that's the
../obama_wave/O26_591.wav|so for anyone
../obama_wave/O26_592.wav|wants to use race to the top to
../obama_wave/O26_593.wav|punish teachers you're missing the point our
../obama_wave/O26_596.wav|to provide teachers with the support they need to be as effective
../obama_wave/O26_597.wav|environment for teachers
../obama_wave/O26_600.wav|in the classroom
../obama_wave/O26_601.wav|Nations in Asia and Europe
../obama_wave/O26_602.wav|standards
../obama_wave/O26_603.wav|to make sure their teachers and students are
../obama_wave/O26_604.wav|at the same high levels throughout their
../obama_wave/O26_605.wav|that's one of the reasons that their children
../obama_wave/O26_606.wav|doing better than us
../obama_wave/O26_608.wav|controversy about National standards Common
../obama_wave/O26_609.wav|that violates the principle local
../obama_wave/O26_611.wav|that we need to think about but but but but
../obama_wave/O26_612.wav|but
../obama_wave/O26_614.wav|race to the top sets
../obama_wave/O26_615.wav|instead of Washington imposing standards
../obama_wave/O26_617.wav|what states to adopt common standards
../obama_wave/O26_618.wav|from the bottom up that doesn't mean
../obama_wave/O26_619.wav|it means higher standards better standard
../obama_wave/O26_620.wav|standards the clarify what our teach
../obama_wave/O26_621.wav|are expected to teach and what are
../obama_wave/O26_622.wav|are expected to learn so high school graduates
../obama_wave/O26_623.wav|actually prepared for college and a career I
../obama_wave/O26_624.wav|I don't want to see young people get a diploma but they
../obama_wave/O26_625.wav|read that diploma
../obama_wave/O26_628.wav|so far about 30 States have come together to Em
../obama_wave/O26_63.wav|but I want to remind you
../obama_wave/O26_630.wav|more states are expected to do so in the coming weeks
../obama_wave/O26_631.wav|and by the way there's different from no child left
../obama_wave/O26_632.wav|time because what that did was it gave the States the wrong
../obama_wave/O26_634.wav|so the school districts wouldn't be penalised
../obama_wave/O26_635.wav|when their students fell short
../obama_wave/O26_636.wav|and what's happened now is at least two States Illinois
../obama_wave/O26_637.wav|Oklahoma that lowered standards in respons
../obama_wave/O26_638.wav|spell behind no child left
../obama_wave/O26_64.wav|what things were like in August
../obama_wave/O26_640.wav|partly in response to race to the top
../obama_wave/O26_641.wav|and part of making sure
../obama_wave/O26_642.wav|are young people meet these high standards is
../obama_wave/O26_643.wav|test that accurately measure whether they are
../obama_wave/O26_645.wav|when we talk about testing
../obama_wave/O26_646.wav|parents worry that it means
../obama_wave/O26_647.wav|teaching to the test some
../obama_wave/O26_648.wav|repeat that tests are culturally biased
../obama_wave/O26_649.wav|teachers worry that they'll be
../obama_wave/O26_650.wav|did solely on the basis of a single standardised test
../obama_wave/O26_651.wav|everybody thinks that's unfair
../obama_wave/O26_652.wav|it is unfair
../obama_wave/O26_655.wav|applied in a way that helps
../obama_wave/O26_656.wav|stifling
../obama_wave/O26_657.wav|what teachers and students do in the class
../obama_wave/O26_658.wav|test that don't dictate what's
../obama_wave/O26_659.wav|but tell us what has been learnt
../obama_wave/O26_66.wav|are economy was in free fall
../obama_wave/O26_660.wav|what's the measure how well are children are Mastering
../obama_wave/O26_661.wav|complex
../obama_wave/O26_662.wav|and test the track how well our
../obama_wave/O26_663.wav|are growing academically so we can catch
../obama_wave/O26_664.wav|falling behind and help them before
../obama_wave/O26_666.wav|because of race to the top
../obama_wave/O26_667.wav|states are also finding innovative ways to move beyond
../obama_wave/O26_668.wav|having just a snapshot of where
../obama_wave/O26_669.wav|and towards a real-time picture that
../obama_wave/O26_67.wav|we are just
../obama_wave/O26_670.wav|how far they've come and how far they have to go
../obama_wave/O26_673.wav|cancel teaching and their focus on
../obama_wave/O26_674.wav|where students need help the most
../obama_wave/O26_676.wav|sometimes the schools problems run so deep
../obama_wave/O26_677.wav|you can do the better assessments and the higher standard
../obama_wave/O26_678.wav|in a more challenging curriculum and that's not enough
../obama_wave/O26_679.wav|if
../obama_wave/O26_680.wav|isn't producing graduates with even the most
../obama_wave/O26_683.wav|something needs to be done differently
../obama_wave/O26_684.wav|the definition of somebody once said of Madness
../obama_wave/O26_685.wav|you do the same thing over and over again and keep expecting
../obama_wave/O26_686.wav|different result
../obama_wave/O26_687.wav|if we want success for
../obama_wave/O26_688.wav|we can't accept failure in our
../obama_wave/O26_689.wav|decade after decade
../obama_wave/O26_690.wav|that's why we're challenging States to turn around
../obama_wave/O26_691.wav|are 5
../obama_wave/O26_692.wav|lowest performing schools
../obama_wave/O26_694.wav|African American or hispanic kids
../obama_wave/O26_696.wav|testing over 4 billion dollars
../obama_wave/O26_697.wav|to help them do that to transform those schools
../obama_wave/O26_70.wav|we're sweeping the nation
../obama_wave/O26_700.wav|this isn't about unlike no child left behind
../obama_wave/O26_701.wav|this isn't about labeling a troubled school a failure
../obama_wave/O26_702.wav|and then just throwing up your hands and saying well
../obama_wave/O26_703.wav|we're giving up on you it's about investing in that school
../obama_wave/O26_704.wav|and recruiting the whole community to help turn
../obama_wave/O26_705.wav|round and identifying viable options
../obama_wave/O26_706.wav|how to move forward on some
../obama_wave/O26_707.wav|that's going to mean restarting the school under different
../obama_wave/O26_709.wav|public school formed by parents
../obama_wave/O26_71.wav|and we were on the ver
../obama_wave/O26_710.wav|specific leaders who got broadly
../obama_wave/O26_711.wav|some people don't like charter school
../obama_wave/O26_713.wav|other public schools that also need support
../obama_wave/O26_714.wav|charter schools aren't a magic bullet
../obama_wave/O26_715.wav|I want to get States and school districts the chance
../obama_wave/O26_716.wav|try new things if a charter school work
../obama_wave/O26_717.wav|then let's apply those
../obama_wave/O26_72.wav|financial crisis
../obama_wave/O26_720.wav|so no I don't support all chart
../obama_wave/O26_721.wav|but I do support good charter schools
../obama_wave/O26_723.wav|call mastery in Philadelphia
../obama_wave/O26_724.wav|and then just two years three of
../obama_wave/O26_725.wav|pause the master has taken over
../obama_wave/O26_726.wav|have seen reading in math levels nearly double
../obama_wave/O26_727.wav|in some cases trip
../obama_wave/O26_728.wav|he knows what I'm talking about
../obama_wave/O26_729.wav|one school called Pickett
../obama_wave/O26_73.wav|economy
../obama_wave/O26_730.wav|went from just 14% of students being
../obama_wave/O26_731.wav|70%
../obama_wave/O26_734.wav|here's the kicker at the same time
../obama_wave/O26_735.wav|academic performance improved
../obama_wave/O26_736.wav|dropped by 80%
../obama_wave/O26_737.wav|80% and that's no
../obama_wave/O26_74.wav|second Great Depression
../obama_wave/O26_740.wav|school like master you can do it
../obama_wave/O26_742.wav|troubled school can do
../obama_wave/O26_743.wav|but that means we're going to have to shake some things up
../obama_wave/O26_744.wav|setting
../obama_wave/O26_745.wav|common standards empower
../obama_wave/O26_746.wav|what's the meat partnering with
../obama_wave/O26_747.wav|directions to achieve excellence in the classroom
../obama_wave/O26_748.wav|kidding our children all of them to graduate ready for
../obama_wave/O26_749.wav|ready for a career ready to make most of their lives
../obama_wave/O26_75.wav|so from the moment
../obama_wave/O26_750.wav|none of this should be kontrovers
../obama_wave/O26_751.wav|there should be a
../obama_wave/O26_752.wav|if we weren't doing these things
../obama_wave/O26_753.wav|if only Duncan wasn't trying to shake things up
../obama_wave/O26_755.wav|the rest of the top isn't
../obama_wave/O26_756.wav|the name of an initiative it's sums up
../obama_wave/O26_758.wav|meaningful education reform effort
../obama_wave/O26_759.wav|attempted in this country in generations
../obama_wave/O26_76.wav|I took off
../obama_wave/O26_760.wav|I know there are a number of other steps we need
../obama_wave/O26_761.wav|to take to lift up our education system
../obama_wave/O26_762.wav|like saving teachers jobs across
../obama_wave/O26_763.wav|country from Laos and I'll continue fighting
../obama_wave/O26_764.wav|make those steps and save those jobs
../obama_wave/O26_765.wav|race to the top
../obama_wave/O26_766.wav|everything I've got including using a
../obama_wave/O26_767.wav|prevent some folks from
../obama_wave/O26_769.wav|stop
../obama_wave/O26_77.wav|act immediately to
../obama_wave/O26_771.wav|raise the top one work
../obama_wave/O26_772.wav|naysayers who argue that
../obama_wave/O26_775.wav|just fall back into the same old arguments and
../obama_wave/O26_777.wav|and it is true as I've said since
../obama_wave/O26_779.wav|change his heart I don't know if you've noticed that's
../obama_wave/O26_78.wav|an even greater catastrophe
../obama_wave/O26_780.wav|I got all this grey hair
../obama_wave/O26_781.wav|fixing what was broken in our
../obama_wave/O26_782.wav|Wall Street
../obama_wave/O26_783.wav|fixing what's broken
../obama_wave/O26_784.wav|allocation system is not easy
../obama_wave/O26_785.wav|we want see results overnight
../obama_wave/O26_786.wav|it may take a decade for these Chang
../obama_wave/O26_787.wav|to pay off but that's not
../obama_wave/O26_788.wav|it's a reason
../obama_wave/O26_789.wav|I'm making them right now to feel a sense of urgency
../obama_wave/O26_79.wav|can I know
../obama_wave/O26_792.wav|we also know that a significant is these reforms are
../obama_wave/O26_793.wav|there's going to be one more ingredient
../obama_wave/O26_794.wav|to really make a difference
../obama_wave/O26_795.wav|parents are going to have to get more involved
../obama_wave/O26_799.wav|spark can't
../obama_wave/O26_80.wav|the not everything we did would be popular
../obama_wave/O26_801.wav|well why are you
../obama_wave/O26_802.wav|my parents
../obama_wave/O26_803.wav|parents need help too
../obama_wave/O26_804.wav|parents

../obama_wave/O26_807.wav|substance abuse
../obama_wave/O26_808.wav|we're working on all those front
../obama_wave/O26_809.wav|then
../obama_wave/O26_81.wav|sometimes
../obama_wave/O26_817.wav|and I say I talk about
../obama_wave/O26_818.wav|parental responsibility wherever I talk
../obama_wave/O26_819.wav|education
../obama_wave/O26_82.wav|what do things describ
../obama_wave/O26_820.wav|Michelle Knight happened to be black parents so
../obama_wave/O26_822.wav|yeah I may
../obama_wave/O26_823.wav|I may add a

../obama_wave/O26_917.wav|god bless the United States of America
../obama_wave/O26_92.wav|and because of what we did

../obama_wave/O26_94.wav|our
../obama_wave/O26_95.wav|is growing instead of shrinking
../obama_wave/O26_96.wav|I private sector has been adding jobs

../obama_wave/O26_99.wav|yesterday
../obama_wave/O27_1.wav|today after 2 years
../obama_wave/O27_10.wav|safer and more secure
../obama_wave/O27_100.wav|turn on master bed by the deal before
../obama_wave/O27_101.wav|5 years
../obama_wave/O27_102.wav|restrictions related to arms and 8 years
../obama_wave/O27_103.wav|restrictions related to ballistic missiles

../obama_wave/O27_105.wav|in a new United Nations Security Council resolution
../obama_wave/O27_106.wav|and if you're on violates the deal
../obama_wave/O27_107.wav|all these sanctions will snap back into
../obama_wave/O27_109.wav|and there are very real consequences
../obama_wave/O27_11.wav|in line with a tradition of American leadership
../obama_wave/O27_111.wav|it has the full backing of the
../obama_wave/O27_112.wav|Congress will now have
../obama_wave/O27_113.wav|an opportunity to review the details in my administration
../obama_wave/O27_114.wav|when is ready to provide extensive briefings on how
../obama_wave/O27_115.wav|what's 104 has the
../obama_wave/O27_116.wav|people in Congress review the deal it will be
../obama_wave/O27_117.wav|to consider the alternative
../obama_wave/O27_118.wav|what happens in a world without this deal
../obama_wave/O27_119.wav|without this deal there is
../obama_wave/O27_12.wav|it's not more than 50 years since
../obama_wave/O27_120.wav|area where the world joins us in sanctioning
../obama_wave/O27_121.wav|until it completely dismantles it's NUC
../obama_wave/O27_122.wav|programme nothing we know about the Iran
../obama_wave/O27_123.wav|capitulate under that kind of pressure
../obama_wave/O27_124.wav|and the world would not support an effort to
../obama_wave/O27_125.wav|definitely sanction Iran into submission
../obama_wave/O27_126.wav|we put sanctions in place to get a diplomatic res
../obama_wave/O27_127.wav|and that is what we have done
../obama_wave/O27_128.wav|without this deal there would be no agreed upon
../obama_wave/O27_129.wav|for the Iranian nuclear program
../obama_wave/O27_13.wav|Kennedy stood before the American people and said
../obama_wave/O27_130.wav|Ron could produce operate and test
../obama_wave/O27_132.wav|reactor capable of producing plutonium for a bomb
../obama_wave/O27_133.wav|you would not have any of the inspections that allow us to
../obama_wave/O27_134.wav|connect a covert nuclear weapons program
../obama_wave/O27_135.wav|in other words No Deal means
../obama_wave/O27_136.wav|lasting constraints on iran's nuclear program
../obama_wave/O27_137.wav|such a scenario would make it
../obama_wave/O27_138.wav|likely that other countries in the region would feel
../obama_wave/O27_139.wav|how to pursue their own nuclear programs
../obama_wave/O27_14.wav|let us never negotiate out of Fear but
../obama_wave/O27_140.wav|threatening a nuclear Arms Race in the most volatile reg
../obama_wave/O27_141.wav|of the world
../obama_wave/O27_142.wav|what states with fewer and less effective options
../obama_wave/O27_144.wav|I've been president
../obama_wave/O27_145.wav|commander-in-chief for over 6 years now
../obama_wave/O27_146.wav|time and again I have faced decisions about whether
../obama_wave/O27_147.wav|to use military Force
../obama_wave/O27_148.wav|greatest decision that any president has to make
../obama_wave/O27_149.wav|many times in multiple
../obama_wave/O27_15.wav|never fear to negotiate
../obama_wave/O27_150.wav|I have decided to use Force
../obama_wave/O27_151.wav|never hesitate to do so when it is in our national
../obama_wave/O27_153.wav|Holly believe that our national Security interests
../obama_wave/O27_154.wav|now depends upon preventing Iran
../obama_wave/O27_155.wav|obtaining a nuclear weapon which means
../obama_wave/O27_156.wav|without a diplomatic resolution
../obama_wave/O27_157.wav|or a future US president
../obama_wave/O27_158.wav|would face a decision about whether or not to allow
../obama_wave/O27_159.wav|to obtain a nuclear weapon or whether to use
../obama_wave/O27_16.wav|he was speaking then about the need for discussions between the United
../obama_wave/O27_160.wav|military to stop it
../obama_wave/O27_161.wav|put simply No Deal means a greater chance
../obama_wave/O27_162.wav|of more war in the Middle East
../obama_wave/O27_163.wav|moreover we give nothing up
../obama_wave/O27_164.wav|by testing whether or not this problem can be solved
../obama_wave/O27_166.wav|the worst case scenario Iran violates the deal
../obama_wave/O27_167.wav|the same options that are available to me today
../obama_wave/O27_168.wav|available to any US president in the future
../obama_wave/O27_169.wav|and I have no doubt the 10 or 15 years
../obama_wave/O27_17.wav|Soviet Union which led to efforts to
../obama_wave/O27_170.wav|the person who holds this office
../obama_wave/O27_171.wav|in a stronger position with
../obama_wave/O27_172.wav|further away from a weapon and with the
../obama_wave/O27_173.wav|inspections and transparency that allow us to monitor
../obama_wave/O27_174.wav|the Iranian program
../obama_wave/O27_175.wav|for this reason I believe it would be
../obama_wave/O27_176.wav|responsible to walk away from this deal
../obama_wave/O27_177.wav|but on such a tough issue
../obama_wave/O27_178.wav|it is important that the American people and the represent
../obama_wave/O27_18.wav|the spread of nuclear weapons
../obama_wave/O27_180.wav|after all the details matter
../obama_wave/O27_181.wav|and we've had some of the finest nuclear scientists in the world
../obama_wave/O27_182.wav|working through those details
../obama_wave/O27_183.wav|and we're dealing with a country Iran that has
../obama_wave/O27_184.wav|play sworn adversary of the United States for over 35
../obama_wave/O27_185.wav|so I welcome a
../obama_wave/O27_186.wav|debate in Congress on this issue and I welcome scruton
../obama_wave/O27_187.wav|the details of this agreement
../obama_wave/O27_188.wav|but I will remind Congress that you don't make deals
../obama_wave/O27_19.wav|those days the risk was a catastrophic NUC
../obama_wave/O27_190.wav|Arms control agreements with the Soviet Union when that
../obama_wave/O27_191.wav|when was committed to our destruction
../obama_wave/O27_192.wav|those agreements ultimately made a safer
../obama_wave/O27_193.wav|I am confident that this deal will meet The National
../obama_wave/O27_195.wav|so I will veto any legislation
../obama_wave/O27_196.wav|events the successful implementation of
../obama_wave/O27_197.wav|we do not
../obama_wave/O27_198.wav|to accept an inevitable spiral into
../obama_wave/O27_2.wav|negotiation the United States together
../obama_wave/O27_20.wav|score between two superpowers
../obama_wave/O27_200.wav|and precisely because the stakes are so high
../obama_wave/O27_201.wav|this is not the time for politics
../obama_wave/O27_202.wav|tough Talk from Washington
../obama_wave/O27_203.wav|does not solve problems hard nose
../obama_wave/O27_204.wav|leadership that has
../obama_wave/O27_205.wav|the world's major powers offers
../obama_wave/O27_206.wav|more effective way to verify that Iran is not poor's
../obama_wave/O27_207.wav|a nuclear weapon
../obama_wave/O27_208.wav|now that doesn't mean that this deal will resol
../obama_wave/O27_209.wav|all of our differences with a run
../obama_wave/O27_21.wav|time the risk is that nuclear weapons will spread
../obama_wave/O27_210.wav|concerns expressed by many of our friends
../obama_wave/O27_211.wav|please including Israel and the gulf States
../obama_wave/O27_212.wav|France support for terrorism and its use of prox
../obama_wave/O27_213.wav|the destabilise the region
../obama_wave/O27_214.wav|how does precisely why we are taking the step
../obama_wave/O27_215.wav|weapon would be
../obama_wave/O27_216.wav|and far more dangerous to our friends
../obama_wave/O27_217.wav|enter the world
../obama_wave/O27_218.wav|well we will maintain our own sanctions
../obama_wave/O27_219.wav|ballistic
../obama_wave/O27_22.wav|more and more countries particularly in the middle
../obama_wave/O27_220.wav|program and its human rights violations
../obama_wave/O27_221.wav|we will continue our unprecedented efforts to
../obama_wave/O27_222.wav|Israel security efforts that go
../obama_wave/O27_223.wav|what any American administration has done before
../obama_wave/O27_224.wav|and we will continue the work we began at camp David
../obama_wave/O27_225.wav|the elevator partnership with the gulf States
../obama_wave/O27_226.wav|they're capabilities to counter threats from
../obama_wave/O27_228.wav|however I believe that we must continue
../obama_wave/O27_229.wav|test whether or not this region
../obama_wave/O27_23.wav|the most volatile region in our world
../obama_wave/O27_231.wav|can move in a different Direction
../obama_wave/O27_232.wav|time and again I have made
../obama_wave/O27_233.wav|play Iranian people that we will always be
../obama_wave/O27_234.wav|engagement on the basis of mutual interests
../obama_wave/O27_235.wav|your respect our differences
../obama_wave/O27_237.wav|cannot be ignored but
../obama_wave/O27_238.wav|it is possible to change
../obama_wave/O27_239.wav|cost of violence and rigid ideology
../obama_wave/O27_24.wav|today because
../obama_wave/O27_240.wav|a foreign policy based on threats to attack your
../obama_wave/O27_241.wav|eradicate Israel that's
../obama_wave/O27_242.wav|send a different path
../obama_wave/O27_243.wav|tolerance and peaceful resolution of conflict
../obama_wave/O27_244.wav|leads to more immigration into the
../obama_wave/O27_245.wav|economy more engagement with the international community
../obama_wave/O27_246.wav|and the ability of the Iranian people
../obama_wave/O27_247.wav|this
../obama_wave/O27_248.wav|offers an opportunity to move in a new
../obama_wave/O27_249.wav|we should see it
../obama_wave/O27_25.wav|America negotiated from a position of strength
../obama_wave/O27_250.wav|we have come a long way to reach this
../obama_wave/O27_251.wav|decades of Iranian
../obama_wave/O27_252.wav|program many years of sanctions
../obama_wave/O27_253.wav|how many months of intense negotiation
../obama_wave/O27_254.wav|today I want to thank the members of Congress from both
../obama_wave/O27_255.wav|who helped us put in place the sanctions that have proven
../obama_wave/O27_256.wav|effective as well as the other countries Who Join
../obama_wave/O27_257.wav|I want to thank our negotiating
../obama_wave/O27_258.wav|the United Kingdom
../obama_wave/O27_259.wav|Germany Russia China as well
../obama_wave/O27_26.wav|principal we have stopped the spread
../obama_wave/O27_260.wav|European Union for our unity in this effort
../obama_wave/O27_261.wav|which showed that the world can do
../obama_wave/O27_262.wav|vision of peacefully address
../obama_wave/O27_263.wav|we showed what we can do
../obama_wave/O27_264.wav|when we do not split apart
../obama_wave/O27_265.wav|and finally I want to thank the American negotiating team
../obama_wave/O27_266.wav|we had a team of experts working for
../obama_wave/O27_267.wav|weeks straight on this including our secretary of energy
../obama_wave/O27_269.wav|John Kerry Secretary of State
../obama_wave/O27_27.wav|nuclear weapons in this region
../obama_wave/O27_270.wav|who began his service to this country more than
../obama_wave/O27_274.wav|American diplomacy
../obama_wave/O27_275.wav|history shows that America must lead not just
../obama_wave/O27_277.wav|it shows we are stronger not when
../obama_wave/O27_279.wav|today's announcement marks one more
../obama_wave/O27_28.wav|because of this deal the international community
../obama_wave/O27_280.wav|in this pursuit of a safer
../obama_wave/O27_281.wav|more helpful more hopeful
../obama_wave/O27_282.wav|thank you
../obama_wave/O27_283.wav|hang up bless the United States of America
../obama_wave/O27_29.wav|be able to verify that the Islamic
../obama_wave/O27_3.wav|international partners has achieved something
../obama_wave/O27_30.wav|will not develop a nuclear
../obama_wave/O27_31.wav|this deal
../obama_wave/O27_32.wav|is every single one of the bottom lines that we established
../obama_wave/O27_33.wav|when we achieved a framework earlier this spring
../obama_wave/O27_34.wav|every pathway to a nuclear weapon
../obama_wave/O27_36.wav|necessary to verify that objective
../obama_wave/O27_37.wav|will be put in place
../obama_wave/O27_38.wav|because of this deal Iran will not produce the high
../obama_wave/O27_39.wav|what's geranium and weapons grade plutonium
../obama_wave/O27_4.wav|the Decades of animosity has not
../obama_wave/O27_40.wav|turn the raw materials necessary for a nuclear bomb
../obama_wave/O27_41.wav|because of this deal Iran
../obama_wave/O27_42.wav|remove 2/3 of its installed centr
../obama_wave/O27_43.wav|the machines necessary to produce highly enr
../obama_wave/O27_45.wav|constant international supervision
../obama_wave/O27_46.wav|Iran will not use its advanced centrifuges to
../obama_wave/O27_47.wav|enriched uranium for the next decade
../obama_wave/O27_48.wav|Ron will also get rid of 98%
../obama_wave/O27_49.wav|stockpile of enriched uranium
../obama_wave/O27_5.wav|a comprehensive long-term deal with
../obama_wave/O27_50.wav|put that in perspective Iran currently has a stockpile
../obama_wave/O27_51.wav|reduce up to 10 nuclear weapons because
../obama_wave/O27_52.wav|that's stockpile will be reduced to a
../obama_wave/O27_53.wav|what would be required for a single weap
../obama_wave/O27_54.wav|the stockpile limitation will last
../obama_wave/O27_55.wav|for 15 years because of
../obama_wave/O27_56.wav|Iran will modify the core of its
../obama_wave/O27_58.wav|weapons grade plutonium and it has agreed
../obama_wave/O27_59.wav|ship the spent fuel from the reactor out of the country
../obama_wave/O27_6.wav|that will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weap
../obama_wave/O27_60.wav|for the lifetime of the reactor
../obama_wave/O27_61.wav|beast the next 15 years Iran will not
../obama_wave/O27_62.wav|any new heavy water reactors
../obama_wave/O27_63.wav|because of this deal we will for the
../obama_wave/O27_64.wav|what time being a position to verify all of these
../obama_wave/O27_65.wav|that means this deal is not
../obama_wave/O27_67.wav|inspectors will have
../obama_wave/O27_68.wav|do you have an access to Ron's key nuclear facilities
../obama_wave/O27_69.wav|Iran will have access to iran's entire

../obama_wave/O27_71.wav|it's conversion facility and
../obama_wave/O27_72.wav|centrifuge manufacturing and storage facilities
../obama_wave/O27_73.wav|this ensures that Iran will not be able to
../obama_wave/O27_74.wav|materials from known facilities to covert ones
../obama_wave/O27_75.wav|some of these transparency measures will be
../obama_wave/O27_76.wav|for 25 years
../obama_wave/O27_77.wav|because of this deal inspectors will also be able to
../obama_wave/O27_78.wav|access any suspicious location
../obama_wave/O27_79.wav|put simply the organisation responsible for the inspection
../obama_wave/O27_8.wav|can diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change
../obama_wave/O27_80.wav|the iaea will have access
../obama_wave/O27_81.wav|when necessary

../obama_wave/O2_1024.wav|but overall I

../obama_wave/O2_1032.wav|what does a state senator she she
../obama_wave/O2_1033.wav|so the
../obama_wave/O2_1034.wav|I can do is give her the last question as president United States
../obama_wave/O2_1036.wav|well
../obama_wave/O2_1038.wav|and I have a personal question for you because I
../obama_wave/O2_1040.wav|the first lady put the stakes of the 2016
../obama_wave/O2_1043.wav|women
../obama_wave/O2_1045.wav|and
../obama_wave/O2_1051.wav|you know
../obama_wave/O2_1053.wav|parent brags on their daughters or their
../obama_wave/O2_1054.wav|you know if your mom and dad don't
../obama_wave/O2_1056.wav|but me and
../obama_wave/O2_1057.wav|or something
../obama_wave/O2_1058.wav|and and they just
../obama_wave/O2_1059.wav|surprise
../obama_wave/O2_1060.wav|chance and
../obama_wave/O2_1061.wav|impress me
../obama_wave/O2_1062.wav|more more every single day as they grow up
../obama_wave/O2_1063.wav|and
../obama_wave/O2_1064.wav|these days when we talk we talk
../obama_wave/O2_1067.wav|as parent to child but also we learn
../obama_wave/O2_1069.wav|and I think it was really interesting to see how
../obama_wave/O2_107.wav|are you seeking that and would he be
../obama_wave/O2_1070.wav|Sasha reactive they were disappointed
../obama_wave/O2_1072.wav|Peter tension of what their mom said during the campaign
../obama_wave/O2_1073.wav|and believed it because it's consistent
../obama_wave/O2_1074.wav|what we've tried to teach them
../obama_wave/O2_1076.wav|does a father with their mom and what
../obama_wave/O2_1077.wav|ask them to expect
../obama_wave/O2_1078.wav|future
../obama_wave/O2_1079.wav|spouses
../obama_wave/O2_1083.wav|and that the only
../obama_wave/O2_1084.wav|Is the End of the World Is the End of the World
../obama_wave/O2_1085.wav|and so
../obama_wave/O2_1086.wav|knock down you get up brush yourself
../obama_wave/O2_1087.wav|you get back to work and
../obama_wave/O2_1088.wav|tended to be their attitude
../obama_wave/O2_1089.wav|I think neither of them
../obama_wave/O2_109.wav|well
../obama_wave/O2_1090.wav|Nintendo
../obama_wave/O2_1091.wav|pursue a future of politics and
../obama_wave/O2_1094.wav|but
../obama_wave/O2_1096.wav|have grown
../obama_wave/O2_1097.wav|an environment where I think they could not help
../obama_wave/O2_1099.wav|to see that
../obama_wave/O2_11.wav|first
../obama_wave/O2_110.wav|first of all let's
../obama_wave/O2_1100.wav|but see that they have responsib
../obama_wave/O2_1102.wav|that they need to
../obama_wave/O2_1105.wav|their teachers and their
../obama_wave/O2_1106.wav|in ways that try to shed
../obama_wave/O2_1108.wav|just generate
../obama_wave/O2_111.wav|Chelsea Manning
../obama_wave/O2_1110.wav|and I expect that's what they're going to do
../obama_wave/O2_1111.wav|they do not
../obama_wave/O2_1112.wav|they don't maupay
../obama_wave/O2_1116.wav|what
../obama_wave/O2_1118.wav|they have not assumed
../obama_wave/O2_112.wav|does served a
../obama_wave/O2_1120.wav|some of the values that they care
../obama_wave/O2_1121.wav|don't seem as if they were vindicated that
../obama_wave/O2_1122.wav|dramatically America
../obama_wave/O2_1123.wav|I don't think
../obama_wave/O2_1124.wav|I think they
../obama_wave/O2_1125.wav|have
../obama_wave/O2_1126.wav|who are osmosis in part through dinner
../obama_wave/O2_1127.wav|conversations appreciated the fact that this is a big
../obama_wave/O2_113.wav|prison sentence
../obama_wave/O2_1130.wav|guarantee certain outcomes
../obama_wave/O2_1131.wav|but if you if you're engaged and you're involved
../obama_wave/O2_1132.wav|then
../obama_wave/O2_1133.wav|they're a lot more good people in bad in this country and
../obama_wave/O2_1136.wav|the bigger to be a part of
../obama_wave/O2_1137.wav|stop and I expect there will be and
../obama_wave/O2_1138.wav|in that sense they are representative of
../obama_wave/O2_114.wav|so the notion that
../obama_wave/O2_1140.wav|I've been asked I had
../obama_wave/O2_1141.wav|I've had some off-road conversations with some jour
../obama_wave/O2_1142.wav|where they said ok you seem like you're
../obama_wave/O2_1144.wav|and I've said no I
../obama_wave/O2_1145.wav|what I'm saying really is what
../obama_wave/O2_1147.wav|I believe in the American people
../obama_wave/O2_1148.wav|I believe that
../obama_wave/O2_1149.wav|people are more good than bad
../obama_wave/O2_115.wav|the average person who was think
../obama_wave/O2_1151.wav|I believe tragic things happen
../obama_wave/O2_1153.wav|play if we work hard
../obama_wave/O2_1155.wav|cost that feel true and feel right
../obama_wave/O2_1156.wav|the world gets a little better
../obama_wave/O2_1157.wav|that's what
../obama_wave/O2_1159.wav|can the young people I've worked with
../obama_wave/O2_116.wav|disclosing vital
../obama_wave/O2_1160.wav|I couldn't be proud of them
../obama_wave/O2_1162.wav|Obama this is this is what I
../obama_wave/O2_1166.wav|but at my
../obama_wave/O2_1167.wav|I think we're going to be ok we
../obama_wave/O2_1169.wav|and I know that you will help us do that thank you very much
../obama_wave/O2_117.wav|information would think that it goes on punish
../obama_wave/O2_1170.wav|fast forward good luck
../obama_wave/O2_119.wav|I don't think would get that impression
../obama_wave/O2_12.wav|turn in touch with the Bush family today after
../obama_wave/O2_120.wav|the sense that
../obama_wave/O2_121.wav|call Sue Manning has served
../obama_wave/O2_122.wav|has been my view that
../obama_wave/O2_123.wav|giving she
../obama_wave/O2_124.wav|when to trial
../obama_wave/O2_125.wav|due process
../obama_wave/O2_126.wav|carried out that she
../obama_wave/O2_127.wav|took responsibility for her
../obama_wave/O2_128.wav|crime
../obama_wave/O2_129.wav|the sense that she received was
../obama_wave/O2_13.wav|about President George HW bush and
../obama_wave/O2_130.wav|very disproportion
../obama_wave/O2_131.wav|disproportionate relative to what
../obama_wave/O2_132.wav|other Lakers had received
../obama_wave/O2_134.wav|he had served a significant amount of time that
../obama_wave/O2_135.wav|it made sense to commute and
../obama_wave/O2_137.wav|you're I feel very comfortable
../obama_wave/O2_138.wav|that Justice has been served and
../obama_wave/O2_139.wav|a message is still been sent that
../obama_wave/O2_14.wav|Porsche being admitted to the hospital this morning
../obama_wave/O2_140.wav|when it comes to our national
../obama_wave/O2_142.wav|possible we need folks
../obama_wave/O2_143.wav|may have legitimate concerns about
../obama_wave/O2_144.wav|actions of government or their superiors or the agencies
../obama_wave/O2_146.wav|established channels and
../obama_wave/O2_15.wav|they have not only dedicated
../obama_wave/O2_151.wav|may find ourselves at
../obama_wave/O2_152.wav|cards with policies that are set but
../obama_wave/O2_154.wav|I'm dealing with people in
../obama_wave/O2_157.wav|security and the ability of our military
../obama_wave/O2_158.wav|intelligence teams or embassies to function
../obama_wave/O2_159.wav|and that has to
../obama_wave/O2_16.wav|their lives to this country they have
../obama_wave/O2_161.wav|with respect to WikiLeaks
../obama_wave/O2_164.wav|the conclusions of the
../obama_wave/O2_165.wav|intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking
../obama_wave/O2_166.wav|we're not conclusive as to whether
../obama_wave/O2_17.wav|can a constant source of friendship
../obama_wave/O2_170.wav|the DNC emails that were late
../obama_wave/O2_171.wav|I don't pay a lot of attention
../obama_wave/O2_174.wav|refer you to the justice department
../obama_wave/O2_175.wav|any criminal investigations
../obama_wave/O2_176.wav|extradition issues that may

../obama_wave/O2_179.wav|in this new cyber
../obama_wave/O2_18.wav|support and good counsel for
../obama_wave/O2_181.wav|we're going to have to
../obama_wave/O2_183.wav|of accountability and openness and transparency that is the
../obama_wave/O2_184.wav|Marco bar democracy but also
../obama_wave/O2_185.wav|recognise that there are
../obama_wave/O2_187.wav|bad actors out there who
../obama_wave/O2_188.wav|who's that same openness in ways that hurt us
../obama_wave/O2_189.wav|whether that's in trying
../obama_wave/O2_19.wav|show me over the years
../obama_wave/O2_190.wav|commit financial crimes or trying to
../obama_wave/O2_191.wav|commit x
../obama_wave/O2_192.wav|folks Who
../obama_wave/O2_193.wav|want to interfere with our
../obama_wave/O2_194.wav|and we're going to have to continually
../obama_wave/O2_195.wav|build
../obama_wave/O2_196.wav|the best of our democ
../obama_wave/O2_197.wav|preserved that our national
../obama_wave/O2_198.wav|play an intelligence agencies have
../obama_wave/O2_199.wav|advertising to our
../obama_wave/O2_2.wav|let me start off by saying
../obama_wave/O2_201.wav|still keeps citizens up to
../obama_wave/O2_202.wav|what the government's doing on their behalf
../obama_wave/O2_203.wav|but with
../obama_wave/O2_204.wav|connect to Chelsea Manning I looked at the particulars of
../obama_wave/O2_206.wav|and I felt
../obama_wave/O2_207.wav|in light of all the circumstances
../obama_wave/O2_208.wav|the commuting
../obama_wave/O2_209.wav|entirely appropriate
../obama_wave/O2_21.wav|as we know and so
../obama_wave/O2_210.wav|Margaret Brennan
../obama_wave/O2_216.wav|do you think that's an effective strategy
../obama_wave/O2_217.wav|knowing this office and Mr Trump
../obama_wave/O2_22.wav|we want to send our prayers and our love
../obama_wave/O2_223.wav|number one I think it is in America's interest
../obama_wave/O2_224.wav|and the world's interest that we have a
../obama_wave/O2_225.wav|constructive relationship with Russia
../obama_wave/O2_226.wav|been my approach throughout my presidency
../obama_wave/O2_227.wav|our interests of overlapped we've worked together
../obama_wave/O2_228.wav|at the beginning of my term
../obama_wave/O2_229.wav|did what I could to encourage Russia to
../obama_wave/O2_23.wav|really good people
../obama_wave/O2_230.wav|constructive member of the international community
../obama_wave/O2_231.wav|and try to work with
../obama_wave/O2_232.wav|the president
../obama_wave/O2_233.wav|government of Russia in help
../obama_wave/O2_235.wav|economy improve their economy
../obama_wave/O2_236.wav|use the in
../obama_wave/O2_237.wav|tell us the Russian people in more constructive ways
../obama_wave/O2_238.wav|I think it's
../obama_wave/O2_239.wav|say that after President Putin came back into the
../obama_wave/O2_24.wav|second thing I want to do is to thank all
../obama_wave/O2_240.wav|that an escalating
../obama_wave/O2_241.wav|anti-american rhetoric
../obama_wave/O2_242.wav|and
../obama_wave/O2_243.wav|an approach to Global affairs that
../obama_wave/O2_244.wav|seem to be
../obama_wave/O2_246.wav|America's trying to do must be bad for Russia
../obama_wave/O2_249.wav|return
../obama_wave/O2_25.wav|some of you have been
../obama_wave/O2_251.wav|existed
../obama_wave/O2_252.wav|cold war has made the relation
../obama_wave/O2_253.wav|more difficult and
../obama_wave/O2_254.wav|was hammered home win Russ
../obama_wave/O2_256.wav|the reason we impose the sanctions
../obama_wave/O2_257.wav|was not
../obama_wave/O2_258.wav|because of
../obama_wave/O2_26.wav|cover me for a long time
../obama_wave/O2_260.wav|sovereignty of
../obama_wave/O2_261.wav|play country Ukraine
../obama_wave/O2_262.wav|encroached upon
../obama_wave/O2_263.wav|by Force by Russia
../obama_wave/O2_264.wav|that wasn't our judgement that was the judgement of the entire
../obama_wave/O2_265.wav|national community and Russia
../obama_wave/O2_266.wav|two occupy Ukrainian territory
../obama_wave/O2_267.wav|metal in Ukrainian affairs and support
../obama_wave/O2_268.wav|military surrogates Who
../obama_wave/O2_269.wav|have violated basic International
../obama_wave/O2_27.wav|Christie and Lynn some of you
../obama_wave/O2_270.wav|international norms what I've said to the Russians is as soon as
../obama_wave/O2_271.wav|stop doing that the sanctions will be removed
../obama_wave/O2_272.wav|and I think if
../obama_wave/O2_273.wav|it would probably best serve not
../obama_wave/O2_274.wav|American interests but also
../obama_wave/O2_275.wav|what's the preserving international norms if we
../obama_wave/O2_276.wav|made sure that
../obama_wave/O2_277.wav|we don't confuse
../obama_wave/O2_278.wav|why do sanctions have been imposed
../obama_wave/O2_279.wav|the whole set of other issues
../obama_wave/O2_28.wav|yeah I've just gotten to know
../obama_wave/O2_280.wav|on nuclear issues
../obama_wave/O2_281.wav|in my first term we negotiated the start
../obama_wave/O2_282.wav|2:30 and that has substantially reduced
../obama_wave/O2_283.wav|are nuclear stockpiles both
../obama_wave/O2_284.wav|and the United States I was prepared to go further I told
../obama_wave/O2_286.wav|turn on willing to negotiate if
../obama_wave/O2_287.wav|president elect Trump is able to restart
../obama_wave/O2_288.wav|fox in a serious way I think there's remains a lot
../obama_wave/O2_289.wav|home for R2 countries to
../obama_wave/O2_29.wav|you have travelled the world together we
../obama_wave/O2_290.wav|reduce our stockpiles and part of the reason
../obama_wave/O2_291.wav|been successful on our non-proliferation
../obama_wave/O2_292.wav|and on our nuclear security agenda is
../obama_wave/O2_294.wav|that continues
../obama_wave/O2_295.wav|I think it's important just to remember that
../obama_wave/O2_296.wav|the reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia
../obama_wave/O2_297.wav|has to do with their actions in Ukraine
../obama_wave/O2_298.wav|and it is important for the United States to stand up
../obama_wave/O2_299.wav|for the basic
../obama_wave/O2_3.wav|I was sorely tempted
../obama_wave/O2_301.wav|smaller countries
../obama_wave/O2_302.wav|before I expect Russia and Ukraine to have
../obama_wave/O2_303.wav|strong relationship they are hist
../obama_wave/O2_304.wav|bound together in all sorts of
../obama_wave/O2_306.wav|and this is a good example of
../obama_wave/O2_307.wav|vital role that America has to continue to play
../obama_wave/O2_308.wav|Around the World in preserving basic norm
../obama_wave/O2_309.wav|whether it's advocating on bath
../obama_wave/O2_31.wav|I've offered advice that I thought was pretty
../obama_wave/O2_310.wav|advocating on behalf of
../obama_wave/O2_311.wav|advocating on behalf of freedom of
../obama_wave/O2_312.wav|yeah the United States
../obama_wave/O2_313.wav|that's not always been perfect
../obama_wave/O2_314.wav|disregard their times where we
../obama_wave/O2_315.wav|by necessity or dealing with allies
../obama_wave/O2_316.wav|friends or partners
../obama_wave/O2_317.wav|themselves are not
../obama_wave/O2_318.wav|meeting the standards that we would like to see met
../obama_wave/O2_319.wav|when it comes to international rules
../obama_wave/O2_32.wav|sound like don't do stupid stuff
../obama_wave/O2_320.wav|but I can
../obama_wave/O2_323.wav|the United States typically has been on the
../obama_wave/O2_326.wav|because if we the largest
../obama_wave/O2_327.wav|strongest
../obama_wave/O2_328.wav|country and Democracy in the world
../obama_wave/O2_329.wav|are not
../obama_wave/O2_33.wav|and even
../obama_wave/O2_330.wav|stand up on behalf of these values
../obama_wave/O2_331.wav|certainly China Russia
../obama_wave/O2_333.wav|Kevin Court
../obama_wave/O2_334.wav|you have been a strong
../obama_wave/O2_335.wav|order of the idea of a peaceful trance
../obama_wave/O2_336.wav|demonstrated
../obama_wave/O2_338.wav|speak there are more than 5 dozen
../obama_wave/O2_339.wav|are Democrats that are going to boycott
../obama_wave/O2_34.wav|you complained about my long answers
../obama_wave/O2_340.wav|inauguration of the incoming president
../obama_wave/O2_341.wav|what's that and what message would
../obama_wave/O2_342.wav|listen to Democrats to better demonstrate
../obama_wave/O2_343.wav|play peaceful transfer of power and if I
../obama_wave/O2_345.wav|do you like previously and without getting
../obama_wave/O2_347.wav|use that opportunity to
../obama_wave/O2_348.wav|convince him to take a fresh look
../obama_wave/O2_349.wav|some of the important ideas that you will leave
../obama_wave/O2_35.wav|I just wanted to know that the only reason they were long
../obama_wave/O2_350.wav|this office where the maintaining
../obama_wave/O2_351.wav|some idea
../obama_wave/O2_353.wav|were you able to use personal stories to try to convince him
../obama_wave/O2_354.wav|play how successful were you
../obama_wave/O2_355.wav|well I won't go on the details of my conversations
../obama_wave/O2_357.wav|at times they
../obama_wave/O2_358.wav|fairly lengthy and
../obama_wave/O2_359.wav|they've been substantive
../obama_wave/O2_361.wav|whether I've been convincing
../obama_wave/O2_362.wav|I have offered
../obama_wave/O2_363.wav|best advice council about
../obama_wave/O2_364.wav|certain issues both
../obama_wave/O2_365.wav|foreign and domestic and
../obama_wave/O2_366.wav|my working
../obama_wave/O2_367.wav|is that having one in election
../obama_wave/O2_368.wav|oppose to a number
../obama_wave/O2_369.wav|my initiatives and
../obama_wave/O2_37.wav|but I have
../obama_wave/O2_370.wav|certain aspects of my vision for where the country needs
../obama_wave/O2_373.wav|go forward with his Vision and
../obama_wave/O2_374.wav|values and I don't expect
../obama_wave/O2_376.wav|enormous over
../obama_wave/O2_377.wav|it may be that on
../obama_wave/O2_379.wav|the complexities of how to
../obama_wave/O2_38.wav|working with all of you that does not of course
../obama_wave/O2_380.wav|provide Healthcare for everybody something he says he
../obama_wave/O2_382.wav|wants to make sure that he is
../obama_wave/O2_383.wav|encouraging job creation and
../obama_wave/O2_387.wav|but I don't think we'll
../obama_wave/O2_389.wav|sit behind that desk
../obama_wave/O2_39.wav|I've enjoyed every story that you have filed
../obama_wave/O2_390.wav|I think a lot of his views are going to be shaped by
../obama_wave/O2_393.wav|I can tell you that and then this is something
../obama_wave/O2_395.wav|this is a job of
../obama_wave/O2_396.wav|watch magnitude that you can't
../obama_wave/O2_397.wav|by yourself you are enormous
../obama_wave/O2_398.wav|Alliance on 18
../obama_wave/O2_399.wav|your cabinet
../obama_wave/O2_40.wav|but that's the point of this relationship you're
../obama_wave/O2_400.wav|senior White House staff all the way to
../obama_wave/O2_401.wav|fairly junior folks
../obama_wave/O2_402.wav|executing on significant
../obama_wave/O2_403.wav|and so
../obama_wave/O2_404.wav|how you put a team together to make sure that
../obama_wave/O2_405.wav|they're getting you the best
../obama_wave/O2_406.wav|and they are teeing up
../obama_wave/O2_408.wav|that's probably
../obama_wave/O2_409.wav|the most useful advice the
../obama_wave/O2_411.wav|if you find yourself
../obama_wave/O2_412.wav|isolated because
../obama_wave/O2_415.wav|creative process that is fact
../obama_wave/O2_416.wav|and probing and asking
../obama_wave/O2_417.wav|hard questions about
../obama_wave/O2_419.wav|thanks and as I indicated
../obama_wave/O2_42.wav|sceptics you're supposed to ask me tough questions
../obama_wave/O2_420.wav|and some of my previous remarks
../obama_wave/O2_421.wav|Biden back
../obama_wave/O2_422.wav|with respect
../obama_wave/O2_423.wav|inauguration I'm not going to comment on those issues
../obama_wave/O2_425.wav|I have been checking the weather
../obama_wave/O2_426.wav|Martin by the fact that it won't be as cold as my first inauguration
../obama_wave/O2_428.wav|general rodrig
../obama_wave/O2_43.wav|you're not supposed to be complimentary
../obama_wave/O2_431.wav|are you fearful for
../obama_wave/O2_434.wav|what did you mean when you said you would come back
../obama_wave/O2_436.wav|why did
../obama_wave/O2_439.wav|I did not mean that I was going to be running for anything
../obama_wave/O2_44.wav|but you're supposed to cast a critical eye on
../obama_wave/O2_440.wav|stop
../obama_wave/O2_442.wav|it's important for me to take
../obama_wave/O2_443.wav|time to process this
../obama_wave/O2_445.wav|make sure that my
../obama_wave/O2_446.wav|with whom I will be celebrating
../obama_wave/O2_447.wav|25th anniversary this year is willing to
../obama_wave/O2_448.wav|re-up and put up with me for a little bit longer
../obama_wave/O2_45.wav|folks who hold enormous power
../obama_wave/O2_450.wav|I want to do some writing I want to
../obama_wave/O2_452.wav|quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk
../obama_wave/O2_453.wav|how much
../obama_wave/O2_454.wav|I want to spend precious time with my
../obama_wave/O2_455.wav|so those are my priorities this
../obama_wave/O2_456.wav|but as I said before I'm still a citizen
../obama_wave/O2_457.wav|and I think it is important for
../obama_wave/O2_458.wav|Democrats or progressives who
../obama_wave/O2_459.wav|play
../obama_wave/O2_46.wav|and make sure that we
../obama_wave/O2_461.wav|be able to distinguish between
../obama_wave/O2_462.wav|the normal
../obama_wave/O2_463.wav|back and forth ebb and flow
../obama_wave/O2_466.wav|no expand this
../obama_wave/O2_467.wav|Graham or eliminate this program
../obama_wave/O2_468.wav|how concern
../obama_wave/O2_469.wav|tell me about air pollution or
../obama_wave/O2_470.wav|climate change those are
../obama_wave/O2_471.wav|normal parts of the debate
../obama_wave/O2_472.wav|and as I've said before
../obama_wave/O2_473.wav|issues and sometimes
../obama_wave/O2_474.wav|I'm confident about the
../obama_wave/O2_476.wav|we got a new President and
../obama_wave/O2_478.wav|back and forth in congress
../obama_wave/O2_481.wav|there's a difference between that normal function
../obama_wave/O2_482.wav|politics
../obama_wave/O2_483.wav|and
../obama_wave/O2_484.wav|how many shoes are certain moments where I
../obama_wave/O2_485.wav|are core values may be at stake
../obama_wave/O2_487.wav|I put in that category if
../obama_wave/O2_488.wav|call systematic discrimination
../obama_wave/O2_49.wav|for the most part
../obama_wave/O2_490.wav|I put in that category
../obama_wave/O2_492.wav|explicit or
../obama_wave/O2_493.wav|functional
../obama_wave/O2_494.wav|obstacles to people being able to
../obama_wave/O2_496.wav|I put in that category
../obama_wave/O2_497.wav|instit
../obama_wave/O2_498.wav|efforts to silence
../obama_wave/O2_5.wav|Express conference but Michelle
../obama_wave/O2_50.wav|where is that I could app
../obama_wave/O2_500.wav|and for me at least I would put in
../obama_wave/O2_501.wav|category
../obama_wave/O2_502.wav|efforts to round
../obama_wave/O2_503.wav|kids who have grown
../obama_wave/O2_504.wav|for all practical purposes are American kids
../obama_wave/O2_505.wav|and send them someplace else
../obama_wave/O2_506.wav|when they love
../obama_wave/O2_507.wav|country they are
../obama_wave/O2_508.wav|classmates
../obama_wave/O2_509.wav|are now
../obama_wave/O2_51.wav|for fairness even if I didn't always agree with
../obama_wave/O2_510.wav|community colleges or in some cases
../obama_wave/O2_514.wav|politics
../obama_wave/O2_515.wav|punish those kids
../obama_wave/O2_516.wav|I think
../obama_wave/O2_517.wav|be something that would merit me speaking up
../obama_wave/O2_518.wav|it doesn't mean that I would
../obama_wave/O2_519.wav|get on the ballad anywhere
../obama_wave/O2_52.wav|and having
../obama_wave/O2_520.wav|with respect to Watford
../obama_wave/O2_522.wav|we underwent a mon
../obama_wave/O2_523.wav|shift in our policy
../obama_wave/O2_524.wav|my view was after 50
../obama_wave/O2_525.wav|a policy not working it
../obama_wave/O2_526.wav|thanks for us to try to reopen diplomatic rel
../obama_wave/O2_527.wav|to eng
../obama_wave/O2_528.wav|Cuban government to be honest with them but the strong
../obama_wave/O2_53.wav|this building has made
../obama_wave/O2_531.wav|medical repression and treatment of
../obama_wave/O2_532.wav|dissenters and freedom of press and
../obama_wave/O2_533.wav|but that to
../obama_wave/O2_534.wav|progress for the Cuban people
../obama_wave/O2_535.wav|our best shot was to
../obama_wave/O2_536.wav|suddenly have the cub
../obama_wave/O2_537.wav|interacting with Americans
../obama_wave/O2_538.wav|and seeing the incredible success of the Cuban American
../obama_wave/O2_539.wav|community and engaging in
../obama_wave/O2_54.wav|this place work better
../obama_wave/O2_541.wav|that it was through that process of open
../obama_wave/O2_542.wav|hang up
../obama_wave/O2_543.wav|bilateral relations that you would see over time
../obama_wave/O2_544.wav|serious and significant
../obama_wave/O2_545.wav|giving
../obama_wave/O2_547.wav|in a relationship the
../obama_wave/O2_548.wav|which
../obama_wave/O2_549.wav|treated Cuban
../obama_wave/O2_550.wav|completely different from
../obama_wave/O2_552.wav|Guatemala or
../obama_wave/O2_553.wav|or any other part of the world
../obama_wave/O2_554.wav|one that made a distinction between
../obama_wave/O2_557.wav|that was a carry-over of a
../obama_wave/O2_558.wav|that didn't make sense
../obama_wave/O2_559.wav|in this day and age particularly as
../obama_wave/O2_56.wav|made us
../obama_wave/O2_560.wav|opening up travel between the two countries
../obama_wave/O2_561.wav|and so
../obama_wave/O2_562.wav|add very lengthy consultations with the department
../obama_wave/O2_564.wav|with the Cuban government
../obama_wave/O2_565.wav|but we arrived at a policy which we think is
../obama_wave/O2_566.wav|and appropriate to
../obama_wave/O2_567.wav|the changing nature of the relationship between
../obama_wave/O2_57.wav|about how we are doing what we do
../obama_wave/O2_570.wav|I appreciate the
../obama_wave/O2_572.wav|Mr President you have been critic
../obama_wave/O2_573.wav|I'm giving personally attack for the UN security
../obama_wave/O2_577.wav|how old are you
../obama_wave/O2_578.wav|the US leadership in the Arab World and beyond
../obama_wave/O2_58.wav|whether or not we're able to deliver on what's
../obama_wave/O2_581.wav|should have called Israel more accountable
../obama_wave/O2_584.wav|I am
../obama_wave/O2_585.wav|I continue
../obama_wave/O2_586.wav|significantly worried about the Israeli
../obama_wave/O2_588.wav|I'm worried about it
../obama_wave/O2_589.wav|both because I think
../obama_wave/O2_59.wav|buy our constituents
../obama_wave/O2_590.wav|status Quo is unsustainable
../obama_wave/O2_591.wav|is dangerous for Israel
../obama_wave/O2_592.wav|it is bad for
../obama_wave/O2_594.wav|America's national Security
../obama_wave/O2_595.wav|and I came
../obama_wave/O2_596.wav|office want
../obama_wave/O2_597.wav|do everything I could do encourage
../obama_wave/O2_598.wav|serious peace talks between Isra
../obama_wave/O2_599.wav|Palestinians and
../obama_wave/O2_6.wav|fashion senses a little better than mine tells me that's not
../obama_wave/O2_60.wav|and for example every time you
../obama_wave/O2_600.wav|invested a lot of energy a lot of time a lot
../obama_wave/O2_602.wav|is there a second year all the way until last
../obama_wave/O2_604.wav|ultimately what has always been
../obama_wave/O2_605.wav|where is that we cannot force the party
../obama_wave/O2_607.wav|facilitate providing plaits
../obama_wave/O2_608.wav|encourage
../obama_wave/O2_609.wav|but we can't force them to do it
../obama_wave/O2_611.wav|in light of shifts in
../obama_wave/O2_612.wav|politics and Palestinian
../obama_wave/O2_613.wav|text a right word drift
../obama_wave/O2_614.wav|Israeli pol
../obama_wave/O2_615.wav|weakening of
../obama_wave/O2_616.wav|president
../obama_wave/O2_617.wav|a boss's ability to move and take risk
../obama_wave/O2_618.wav|in the Palestinian
../obama_wave/O2_619.wav|in light of all the dangers that
../obama_wave/O2_620.wav|emerged in the region and
../obama_wave/O2_622.wav|about the chaos and and
../obama_wave/O2_623.wav|rise of groups like isoland
../obama_wave/O2_624.wav|deterioration of Syria
../obama_wave/O2_625.wav|light of all those things
../obama_wave/O2_626.wav|what we at least wanted to do
../obama_wave/O2_627.wav|understanding that the two parties wouldn't
../obama_wave/O2_628.wav|is to preserve
../obama_wave/O2_63.wav|what it has given me the ability to go back to my team and say will you
../obama_wave/O2_631.wav|likely the prime minister Netanyahu I've said it
../obama_wave/O2_632.wav|inside of Israel I've said it
../obama_wave/O2_633.wav|to Palestinians as well I don't
../obama_wave/O2_634.wav|play how this issue gets
../obama_wave/O2_635.wav|in a way that
../obama_wave/O2_636.wav|maintains Israel has both
../obama_wave/O2_637.wav|Jewish and a democracy
../obama_wave/O2_638.wav|because if you do not have
../obama_wave/O2_639.wav|then
../obama_wave/O2_64.wav|what's this song before the next press conference
../obama_wave/O2_640.wav|some form or fashion you are extending an
../obama_wave/O2_641.wav|station functionally you
../obama_wave/O2_642.wav|one straight in which
../obama_wave/O2_643.wav|millions of people are
../obama_wave/O2_644.wav|address and operate a second class
../obama_wave/O2_645.wav|resonance
../obama_wave/O2_647.wav|and so the
../obama_wave/O2_648.wav|all of the resolution was to simply say that
../obama_wave/O2_649.wav|settlements the growth of the settlements
../obama_wave/O2_65.wav|I've spent a lot of time
../obama_wave/O2_650.wav|are creating a real
../obama_wave/O2_651.wav|ground that increasingly will make
../obama_wave/O2_652.wav|play two state solution impossible
../obama_wave/O2_653.wav|and we believed consist
../obama_wave/O2_654.wav|where The Possession that have been taken with previous
../obama_wave/O2_655.wav|administration for decades now that
../obama_wave/O2_656.wav|what is important for us to send a
../obama_wave/O2_657.wav|a wake up call that
../obama_wave/O2_658.wav|this moment maybe passing and and
../obama_wave/O2_659.wav|Israeli voters
../obama_wave/O2_66.wav|play in my farewell address talking about
../obama_wave/O2_660.wav|can Palestinians need to understand that this moment
../obama_wave/O2_662.wav|play that then creates a debate
../obama_wave/O2_664.wav|that won't
../obama_wave/O2_667.wav|assessment of what the alternatives are
../obama_wave/O2_668.wav|so we
../obama_wave/O2_669.wav|the president elect will have his own pollock
../obama_wave/O2_67.wav|the state of our democracy
../obama_wave/O2_670.wav|the Ambassador
../obama_wave/O2_671.wav|for the candidate for
../obama_wave/O2_672.wav|the Ambassador ship obviously has very different view
../obama_wave/O2_673.wav|that is their prerogative
../obama_wave/O2_674.wav|what's part of what happens after elections
../obama_wave/O2_675.wav|and I
../obama_wave/O2_676.wav|live user clear
../obama_wave/O2_677.wav|we'll see how
../obama_wave/O2_678.wav|I don't want to
../obama_wave/O2_68.wav|it goes without saying that essential to
../obama_wave/O2_680.wav|I don't want to project today
../obama_wave/O2_681.wav|what could end up happening but obviously it's a VOL
../obama_wave/O2_682.wav|environment what we've seen in the
../obama_wave/O2_683.wav|is when sudden unilateral moves are
../obama_wave/O2_684.wav|that speak to some of the
../obama_wave/O2_685.wav|pictures of sensitivities of
../obama_wave/O2_686.wav|Riverside that can be explosive
../obama_wave/O2_688.wav|provide the context in which
../obama_wave/O2_69.wav|is a free press
../obama_wave/O2_692.wav|navigate to the incoming team
../obama_wave/O2_693.wav|transition processes pay attention to this
../obama_wave/O2_694.wav|because this is this is a volatile stuff
../obama_wave/O2_695.wav|people feel deeply and passionately about this
../obama_wave/O2_696.wav|and
../obama_wave/O2_697.wav|as I said as I said I think
../obama_wave/O2_699.wav|the actions that we take
../obama_wave/O2_7.wav|in January
../obama_wave/O2_70.wav|that is part of how this
../obama_wave/O2_700.wav|have enormous
../obama_wave/O2_701.wav|consequences in ramifications where
../obama_wave/O2_702.wav|were the biggest kid on the on the
../obama_wave/O2_703.wav|and
../obama_wave/O2_704.wav|I think it is
../obama_wave/O2_705.wav|inappropriate for a new president
../obama_wave/O2_706.wav|test all assumptions
../obama_wave/O2_707.wav|re-examine
../obama_wave/O2_708.wav|the old ways of doing things but if you're
../obama_wave/O2_709.wav|play big ships and policy just make sure you
../obama_wave/O2_71.wav|play this country this Grande
../obama_wave/O2_711.wav|consequences and actions
../obama_wave/O2_712.wav|typically create
../obama_wave/O2_714.wav|and so you want to be intentional about it you don't want to
../obama_wave/O2_715.wav|when it comes to
../obama_wave/O2_716.wav|an issue this this volatile
../obama_wave/O2_717.wav|Chris Johnson
../obama_wave/O2_72.wav|government has to work
../obama_wave/O2_724.wav|how do you think LG
../obama_wave/O2_728.wav|I could
../obama_wave/O2_729.wav|Crowder of
../obama_wave/O2_73.wav|it doesn't work if we don't have
../obama_wave/O2_730.wav|the the transformation the second place in our so
../obama_wave/O2_731.wav|just in
../obama_wave/O2_733.wav|and
../obama_wave/O2_734.wav|I said before I think we
../obama_wave/O2_735.wav|some useful contributions to it but the primary
../obama_wave/O2_737.wav|Euros in this stage of
../obama_wave/O2_738.wav|are growth is
../obama_wave/O2_739.wav|Christina society or all the individual
../obama_wave/O2_74.wav|a well informed citizenry and
../obama_wave/O2_741.wav|sons and daughters and
../obama_wave/O2_742.wav|courageously
../obama_wave/O2_743.wav|said this is who
../obama_wave/O2_744.wav|I'm proud of it and
../obama_wave/O2_745.wav|that open people's minds and
../obama_wave/O2_746.wav|open Their Hearts and
../obama_wave/O2_747.wav|eventually was
../obama_wave/O2_748.wav|caught up but
../obama_wave/O2_749.wav|don't think any of that would have happened without the activism
../obama_wave/O2_75.wav|the conduit through which they received the information
../obama_wave/O2_750.wav|in some cases
../obama_wave/O2_751.wav|loud noisy but in some
../obama_wave/O2_753.wav|and I think that
../obama_wave/O2_754.wav|he did as an administration was to
../obama_wave/O2_755.wav|help to
../obama_wave/O2_756.wav|the society
../obama_wave/O2_757.wav|to move
../obama_wave/O2_758.wav|can a better Direction
../obama_wave/O2_759.wav|but to do so
../obama_wave/O2_76.wav|question about what's taking place in the Halls of power so
../obama_wave/O2_760.wav|in a way that didn't create an enormous back
../obama_wave/O2_761.wav|and
../obama_wave/O2_762.wav|was systematic and respect
../obama_wave/O2_763.wav|the fact that
../obama_wave/O2_764.wav|in some cases these issues were controversial
../obama_wave/O2_767.wav|article about it working with the Joint Chiefs making
../obama_wave/O2_768.wav|that we showed this would not have
../obama_wave/O2_769.wav|an impact on the effectiveness of
../obama_wave/O2_770.wav|military on Earth
../obama_wave/O2_771.wav|and then to have
../obama_wave/O2_773.wav|Mike mullane and a Joint Chiefs Who
../obama_wave/O2_774.wav|we're open to evidence and
../obama_wave/O2_775.wav|ultimately
../obama_wave/O2_776.wav|work with me to do the right thing
../obama_wave/O2_777.wav|I am proud of that
../obama_wave/O2_778.wav|but again none of that would have happened
../obama_wave/O2_779.wav|this incredible
../obama_wave/O2_78.wav|establish a baseline of facts and evidence
../obama_wave/O2_780.wav|transformation that was happening in Society
../obama_wave/O2_781.wav|when I gave
../obama_wave/O2_783.wav|I think
../obama_wave/O2_785.wav|somebody that kind
../obama_wave/O2_786.wav|and likeable projecting
../obama_wave/O2_788.wav|living rooms around the country
../obama_wave/O2_789.wav|you know that changed
../obama_wave/O2_79.wav|The Weeknd uses a starting
../obama_wave/O2_790.wav|and that wasn't easy to do for her
../obama_wave/O2_792.wav|what was happening in countless
../obama_wave/O2_793.wav|call across the country so so
../obama_wave/O2_794.wav|that
../obama_wave/O2_796.wav|we may be provided a good
../obama_wave/O2_797.wav|block Downfield
../obama_wave/O2_798.wav|to help the movement advance
../obama_wave/O2_799.wav|I don't think it is
../obama_wave/O2_8.wav|I covered a lot of the ground that I
../obama_wave/O2_80.wav|for the kind of reasons and informed debates
../obama_wave/O2_800.wav|thing that will be reversible
../obama_wave/O2_801.wav|because American
../obama_wave/O2_802.wav|has changed the attitudes of young
../obama_wave/O2_803.wav|call in particular have changed
../obama_wave/O2_804.wav|that doesn't mean that aren't going to be some
../obama_wave/O2_805.wav|better important
../obama_wave/O2_806.wav|legal issues
../obama_wave/O2_807.wav|transgender
../obama_wave/O2_81.wav|ultimately lead to progress
../obama_wave/O2_810.wav|if you talk to
../obama_wave/O2_811.wav|young people
../obama_wave/O2_812.wav|Emilia sasha's generation even
../obama_wave/O2_813.wav|the Republicans even if they're conservative
../obama_wave/O2_814.wav|many of them would tell you
../obama_wave/O2_815.wav|I don't understand how you would
../obama_wave/O2_816.wav|discriminating against somebody because sexual orientation
../obama_wave/O2_82.wav|so my hope is is that you will continue
../obama_wave/O2_822.wav|I'm under your watch people have said that
../obama_wave/O2_83.wav|with the same tenacity that
../obama_wave/O2_830.wav|with that what gap
../obama_wave/O2_835.wav|do you expect this country
../obama_wave/O2_838.wav|people of merit Rise Up
../obama_wave/O2_839.wav|from every
../obama_wave/O2_840.wav|race Faith corn
../obama_wave/O2_842.wav|when we have everybody
../obama_wave/O2_843.wav|get a chance and everybody's on the field
../obama_wave/O2_844.wav|when are being better I think I've used
../obama_wave/O2_846.wav|we killed it in the Olympics
../obama_wave/O2_847.wav|Brazil and
../obama_wave/O2_848.wav|Michelle and I we always have our the Olympic team
../obama_wave/O2_849.wav|here
../obama_wave/O2_85.wav|do the hard work of
../obama_wave/O2_851.wav|anytime you're meeting somebody who's the best at anything
../obama_wave/O2_852.wav|it's impressive
../obama_wave/O2_854.wav|very young people are all
../obama_wave/O2_855.wav|Beam
../obama_wave/O2_856.wav|rude fitness and health and so we
../obama_wave/O2_858.wav|but they are of all shapes sizes
../obama_wave/O2_86.wav|getting the bottom of stories and getting them right
../obama_wave/O2_860.wav|genetic diversity that is
../obama_wave/O2_861.wav|play is remarkable
../obama_wave/O2_862.wav|if you look at a
../obama_wave/O2_864.wav|they're completely
../obama_wave/O2_865.wav|and it's precisely because
../obama_wave/O2_866.wav|those differences that
../obama_wave/O2_867.wav|we got people here who can Excel
../obama_wave/O2_869.wav|and by the way more than half of
../obama_wave/O2_87.wav|and to push those of us in power
../obama_wave/O2_871.wav|because we had the foresight
../obama_wave/O2_872.wav|several decades ago was something called
../obama_wave/O2_875.wav|are women compete better because they have more
../obama_wave/O2_876.wav|foal
../obama_wave/O2_877.wav|so you know I use
../obama_wave/O2_878.wav|what does a metaphor and if in fact
../obama_wave/O2_879.wav|can you continue to keep opportunity opened everybody
../obama_wave/O2_88.wav|to be the best version of ourselves
../obama_wave/O2_881.wav|we'll have a Jewish president
../obama_wave/O2_882.wav|are you president
../obama_wave/O2_883.wav|who knows
../obama_wave/O2_885.wav|some point that nobody really knows what to call
../obama_wave/O2_886.wav|and that's fine
../obama_wave/O2_887.wav|what do
../obama_wave/O2_888.wav|obviously spend a lot of time on this
../obama_wave/O2_889.wav|April at my
../obama_wave/O2_890.wav|go through the whole list
../obama_wave/O2_891.wav|I worry about inequality
../obama_wave/O2_892.wav|because I think that if we are not investing
../obama_wave/O2_893.wav|can
../obama_wave/O2_894.wav|making sure everybody
../obama_wave/O2_895.wav|play a role in this economy the economy will not
../obama_wave/O2_896.wav|fast and I think it will also lead
../obama_wave/O2_897.wav|further and further
../obama_wave/O2_898.wav|separation between us as
../obama_wave/O2_9.wav|recover my farewell address last week
../obama_wave/O2_900.wav|there are a whole bunch of folks who voted for the president elect because
../obama_wave/O2_901.wav|feel forgotten and disenfranchised
../obama_wave/O2_902.wav|play feel as if they're being looked down on they feel as if
../obama_wave/O2_905.wav|don't want to you don't want to have an
../obama_wave/O2_906.wav|a very
../obama_wave/O2_908.wav|everybody else is fighting for scraps as I said
../obama_wave/O2_909.wav|last week because
../obama_wave/O2_91.wav|Ford being an active consumer of your work
../obama_wave/O2_910.wav|often times when racial divisions get magn
../obama_wave/O2_911.wav|because people think well the only way I'm going to get
../obama_wave/O2_914.wav|at the same place I do
../obama_wave/O2_915.wav|I worry about
../obama_wave/O2_916.wav|as
../obama_wave/O2_918.wav|the basic
../obama_wave/O2_919.wav|Henry of our democracy works better
../obama_wave/O2_92.wav|other than always the subject of
../obama_wave/O2_920.wav|we are the only country in the
../obama_wave/O2_921.wav|rather than
../obama_wave/O2_922.wav|I'm at dates
../obama_wave/O2_923.wav|there's a there's an ugly history to that
../obama_wave/O2_924.wav|that we should not be shy about talking about
../obama_wave/O2_927.wav|reason that we are the only country among adv
../obama_wave/O2_929.wav|is it traces directly back to
../obama_wave/O2_93.wav|I want to thank you all for your
../obama_wave/O2_930.wav|and the Legacy
../obama_wave/O2_931.wav|and it became
../obama_wave/O2_932.wav|acceptable to restrict the franchise
../obama_wave/O2_934.wav|that's not who we are that shouldn't be who
../obama_wave/O2_935.wav|that's not when America works best so
../obama_wave/O2_936.wav|I hope that people pay a lot of attention to making
../obama_wave/O2_937.wav|that everybody has a chance to vote make it easier
../obama_wave/O2_94.wav|ordinary service store democracy and would that I
../obama_wave/O2_940.wav|this is something that is constantly been disproved
../obama_wave/O2_941.wav|this this is fake news
../obama_wave/O2_942.wav|the notion that there are a whole bunch of people out there who
../obama_wave/O2_943.wav|are going out there and are not eligible to vote and want to
../obama_wave/O2_947.wav|barriers to people voting
../obama_wave/O2_948.wav|as I've said
../obama_wave/O2_949.wav|political gerrymandering but makes your vote matter less
../obama_wave/O2_950.wav|because politicians have decided you live in
../obama_wave/O2_951.wav|everybody votes the same
../obama_wave/O2_952.wav|these aren't competitive
../obama_wave/O2_954.wav|90% democratic district's 90% Republican
../obama_wave/O2_955.wav|that's bad for
../obama_wave/O2_956.wav|I worry about that
../obama_wave/O2_957.wav|I think it is it is very important for us to make
../obama_wave/O2_958.wav|go to bed are criminal justice system
../obama_wave/O2_959.wav|is fair and just but
../obama_wave/O2_96.wav|who's term apparently is not up I thought
../obama_wave/O2_961.wav|is not politicised
../obama_wave/O2_962.wav|that it maintains
../obama_wave/O2_963.wav|integrity that is outside of
../obama_wave/O2_964.wav|partisan politics at every level
../obama_wave/O2_966.wav|at some point we're going to have to spend
../obama_wave/O2_967.wav|and then this will require some action by the
../obama_wave/O2_969.wav|endless money that goes into our politics
../obama_wave/O2_972.wav|and and
../obama_wave/O2_973.wav|set in my speech on Tuesday
../obama_wave/O2_975.wav|it
../obama_wave/O2_977.wav|it is simply not true
../obama_wave/O2_979.wav|I have more confidence on
../obama_wave/O2_981.wav|operation or the previous generation
../obama_wave/O2_982.wav|I think kids are smarter about it they're more tolerant
../obama_wave/O2_983.wav|play are more inclusive
../obama_wave/O2_984.wav|buy Instinct then we are
../obama_wave/O2_985.wav|and hopefully my presidency maybe
../obama_wave/O2_986.wav|help that along a little bit but
../obama_wave/O2_987.wav|you know we
../obama_wave/O2_988.wav|when when
../obama_wave/O2_989.wav|stress when we feel pressure
../obama_wave/O2_99.wav|are you concerned
../obama_wave/O2_990.wav|when when
../obama_wave/O2_991.wav|we're just fed information that
../obama_wave/O2_992.wav|encourages some of our worst Instincts we tend
../obama_wave/O2_993.wav|go back into some of the
../obama_wave/O2_994.wav|racial fears and racial divisions
../obama_wave/O2_995.wav|stereotypes and
../obama_wave/O2_996.wav|it's very hard for us to break out of those
../obama_wave/O2_997.wav|and to think about people
../obama_wave/O2_998.wav|as people and imagine
../obama_wave/O2_999.wav|B&M that person shoes
../obama_wave/O3_100.wav|war between people's sent

../obama_wave/O3_110.wav|it is in response to this

../obama_wave/O3_122.wav|based on representative democracy
../obama_wave/O3_123.wav|individual rates
../obama_wave/O3_124.wav|and a belief that Nations can meet

../obama_wave/O3_214.wav|Maxim the might somehow makes right
../obama_wave/O3_216.wav|so I come here today to insist

../obama_wave/O3_231.wav|the people in Nations can make their own

../obama_wave/O4_623.wav|what we
../obama_wave/O4_624.wav|play must stand with those who sells struggle
