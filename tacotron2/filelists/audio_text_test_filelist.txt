../input/wav/16354.wav|historical answer
../input/wav/16355.wav|boosted benefits by across the board
../input/wav/16357.wav|because the system crashed so badly last
../input/wav/16358.wav|some of last year's chaos was because
../input/wav/16359.wav|people of fraudulently claiming
../input/wav/16361.wav|that we need to take all of the energy
../input/wav/16364.wav|and not only is that very inefficient
../input/wav/16365.wav|rates that is basically
../input/wav/16366.wav|executives ever find out what i've been
../input/wav/16367.wav|a review four years later found it had a
../input/wav/16368.wav|governor back then ron ramsey
../input/wav/16369.wav|hear this
../input/wav/16370.wav|significantly delayed and innocent
../input/wav/16371.wav|moisture well you're still rocking at
../input/wav/16372.wav|many opted instead just to cut benefits
../input/wav/16374.wav|of our modern workforce and incidentally
../input/wav/16378.wav|he found ways to keep a lot of
../input/wav/16379.wav|how but the whole thing does somehow
../input/wav/16380.wav|if they're considering moving somewhere
../input/wav/16383.wav|requirements
../input/wav/16385.wav|before the pandemic hit
../input/wav/16386.wav|sometimes deliberately
../input/wav/16387.wav|that it's not elmo's fault
../input/wav/16388.wav|u.s got a do-over
../input/wav/16389.wav|attending a resume writing class or
../input/wav/16390.wav|amounts of money
../input/wav/16391.wav|governor and slender man understudy rick
../input/wav/16393.wav|might be a problem for your now one
../input/wav/16395.wav|online how with their internet plan
../input/wav/16396.wav|still managed to get her hair up in two
../input/wav/16397.wav|foster unemployment insurance or
../input/wav/16399.wav|a bad check and deciding to
../input/wav/16401.wav|very precise in how you go after fraud
../input/wav/16402.wav|changes here many experts agree if the
../input/wav/16403.wav|does make sense because
../input/wav/16405.wav|if there aren't two suitable work
../input/wav/16409.wav|fraud unfortunately
../input/wav/16411.wav|nazi problem
../input/wav/16416.wav|s and the basic idea was
../input/wav/16417.wav|it means the level of benefits vary
../input/wav/16418.wav|so how can we fix this going
../input/wav/16419.wav|loads of people ineligible for benefits
../input/wav/16420.wav|no one else could have that name it's
../input/wav/16421.wav|or fail to check a box and get denied
../input/wav/16424.wav|exactly a year since the pandemic hit
../input/wav/16427.wav|billion dollars but the thing is you
../input/wav/16429.wav|our current system was created in the
../input/wav/16430.wav|is just over half of the unemployed the
../input/wav/16431.wav|this pandemic
../input/wav/16432.wav|last year one of whom
../input/wav/16433.wav|you live part-time with dorothy of pet
../input/wav/16435.wav|basic standard for unemployment benefits
../input/wav/16436.wav|that is a hell of a difference and it's
../input/wav/16438.wav|absolutely impossible
../input/wav/16440.wav|shitty technology
../input/wav/16442.wav|i see you elmo's mom but even for the
../input/wav/16444.wav|steve that newsreel of course from the
../input/wav/16446.wav|something that people might want to
../input/wav/16448.wav|helpful in some jobs like for instance
../input/wav/16449.wav|we could help her it'd be better for her
../input/wav/16451.wav|states put in new owners requirements to
../input/wav/16452.wav|our current system is broken again
../input/wav/16453.wav|it seems in the us you can basically
../input/wav/16455.wav|starting in tennessee passed laws
../input/wav/16456.wav|recoup their hip replacement hey
../input/wav/16457.wav|three percent but
../input/wav/16458.wav|caused people there real pain if the
../input/wav/16459.wav|overwhelmed by new claims we featured
../input/wav/16460.wav|and are about to get significantly worse
../input/wav/16461.wav|is already appalling but the very phrase
../input/wav/16463.wav|sometimes not and then it's a tragedy
../input/wav/16464.wav|i think i'm fine unemployment can be a
../input/wav/16465.wav|like most insurance to gather funds
../input/wav/16466.wav|grade cocaine
../input/wav/16471.wav|it'd be much better to go with one
../input/wav/16474.wav|they're over-represented in the states
../input/wav/16475.wav|flagrant example
../input/wav/16476.wav|so that there'd be money available to
../input/wav/16477.wav|look no further than florida america's
../input/wav/16478.wav|because before you give desantis too
../input/wav/16480.wav|with educational films like this to show
../input/wav/16482.wav|even experts tend to, and I'm gonna use
../input/wav/16483.wav|a bake sale to make up the difference.
../input/wav/16484.wav|And just listen to one of the doctors involved
../input/wav/16486.wav|a public health emergency of international concern.
../input/wav/16487.wav|the organization can provide a critical role
../input/wav/16488.wav|Okay. That is just ridiculous.
../input/wav/16489.wav|Think about that! They visited a billion houses!
../input/wav/16490.wav|chances are we're gonna get greeted far less warmly
../input/wav/16491.wav|of infectious diseases.
../input/wav/16492.wav|It's essentially the global health equivalent
../input/wav/16494.wav|or WHO.
../input/wav/16495.wav|what that actually means.
../input/wav/16498.wav|one of the last big countries
../input/wav/16499.wav|And that's not a great perspective
../input/wav/16500.wav|For him, there are two insurmountable problems with the WHO.
../input/wav/16501.wav|while the boat is sinking
../input/wav/16503.wav|"We will be today terminating our relationship."
../input/wav/16504.wav|to fund an organization.
../input/wav/16505.wav|if, that is, Trump is re-elected.
../input/wav/16506.wav|dumbest things we could possibly do.
../input/wav/16507.wav|between America and the USSR at the height of the Cold War,
../input/wav/16508.wav|Now, you're probably already assuming
../input/wav/16509.wav|is likely to set everything back.
../input/wav/16510.wav|exceedingly diplomatic with its member countries
../input/wav/16511.wav|because the fact is only around percent
../input/wav/16512.wav|or there's going to be chaos.
../input/wav/16513.wav|The point is that is why we pay so much relative to China.
../input/wav/16515.wav|because the only thing that is literally a pipe organ for China
../input/wav/16516.wav|And the thing is, Trump is not bluffing.
../input/wav/16517.wav|...which eventually froze states' assessed contributions
../input/wav/16518.wav|during this fucking nightmare of a year,
../input/wav/16519.wav|a pandemic breaks out,
../input/wav/16522.wav|early on, it definitely did.
../input/wav/16523.wav|the United States from the WHO.
../input/wav/16524.wav|And this means our membership in the WHO is
../input/wav/16525.wav|That's nearly every country on Earth.
../input/wav/16527.wav|And the thing is this is yet another depressing example
../input/wav/16528.wav|who just emerged from a coma and forgot how time works.
../input/wav/16529.wav|in how that happens is to have a seat at the table,
../input/wav/16530.wav|its funding especially in the middle of a global pandemic.
../input/wav/16531.wav|In his world, you're either fucking someone
../input/wav/16532.wav|dozens of infectious disease outbreaks around the world,
../input/wav/16533.wav|were it not for Iran-Contra, the war on drugs,
../input/wav/16534.wav|Now as for the question of whether the WHO made mistakes
../input/wav/16535.wav|And it does all of this on a current budget
../input/wav/16536.wav|but something is definitely off there.
../input/wav/16537.wav|on the streets of LA, or on the Dancing with The Stars dance floor.
../input/wav/16538.wav|It's the worst possible decision
../input/wav/16539.wav|But, and this is really important,
../input/wav/16540.wav|And if you're thinking, well surely he can't do that, right?
../input/wav/16541.wav|with a current goal for it to happen in.
../input/wav/16545.wav|where smallpox had to be tackled was India.
../input/wav/16546.wav|And even though Trump likes to pretend that we can
../input/wav/16547.wav|But look, let's say, just for the sake of argument,
../input/wav/16549.wav|And at the beginning of July, he turns that criticism
../input/wav/16550.wav|Oh, and that was by no means a one-off.
../input/wav/16551.wav|at risk, but also contributed to...
../input/wav/16552.wav|which again, it literally isn't.
../input/wav/16553.wav|The WHO is also currently tracking and responding to
../input/wav/16554.wav|in that town as a rouse to gather DNA samples
../input/wav/16555.wav|And if you listen to Mike Pompeo,
../input/wav/16556.wav|so much as in the early stages of a pandemic,
../input/wav/16557.wav|It's true! The WHO completely eradicated smallpox,
../input/wav/16558.wav|'Cause sure, there's gonna be a lot of both going on,
../input/wav/16559.wav|who must have heard the sentence,
../input/wav/16560.wav|the word AIDS for four years.
../input/wav/16561.wav|And yet, despite those significant limitations,
../input/wav/16562.wav|when it comes to cooperating on global health.
../input/wav/16563.wav|because the WHO is right on the edge of
../input/wav/16565.wav|in praising China's coronavirus response.
../input/wav/16567.wav|to a wide range of health issues
../input/wav/16568.wav|which does not date well. Although,
../input/wav/16569.wav|the size of each country's economy and population.
../input/wav/16570.wav|An attitude fully present in her holiday theme,
../input/wav/16571.wav|For a start, if we try and go into
../input/wav/16572.wav|the World Health Organization.
../input/wav/16573.wav|of underfunding a public school and expecting it to hold
../input/wav/16574.wav|is a pipe organ because that's what the word "literally" means.
../input/wav/16575.wav|and what we might be putting at stake.
../input/wav/16576.wav|Unfortunately, the U.S. is the second largest funder
../input/wav/16578.wav|the U.S. verified he was in Abbottabad
../input/wav/16579.wav|Why would we want the right to do that in the first place?
../input/wav/16580.wav|All I'm saying is if I found out tomorrow
../input/wav/16581.wav|Back in the s, the Reagan administration...
../input/wav/16582.wav|as an outbreak emerges.
../input/wav/16585.wav|to join the organization as a separate entity.
../input/wav/16586.wav|Just two months ago, it was finally wiped out
../input/wav/16587.wav|And it gets even worse here
../input/wav/16591.wav|it has absolutely no power on its own
../input/wav/16592.wav|and China, the second largest economy in the world,
../input/wav/16593.wav|And that, by the way, was actually original title
../input/wav/16594.wav|to the organization has said...
../input/wav/16595.wav|How important the WHO's work is, how valid criticisms of it are,
../input/wav/16596.wav|Which might sound like a lot, but it's around the same amount
../input/wav/16597.wav|its member states have consistently acquiesced
../input/wav/16598.wav|that widespread, to completely disappearing within a few years.
../input/wav/16599.wav|than Chrishell visited on Selling Sunset.
../input/wav/16601.wav|and to clearly acknowledge the threat
../input/wav/16602.wav|The bad news is there's exactly one exception
../input/wav/16604.wav|I'm not saying he doesn't think he can do it,
../input/wav/16605.wav|to gain the access it needs for on-the-ground investigations
../input/wav/16606.wav|And very broadly, it coordinates global responses
../input/wav/16607.wav|It can't all be just fucking and getting fucked,
../input/wav/16608.wav|as door-to-door disease destruction.
../input/wav/16609.wav|a Joe Exotic based alternative to Jeopardy.
../input/wav/16610.wav|she's not a baby, she's totally complicit.
../input/wav/16611.wav|You get the listings, you get the results.
../input/wav/16614.wav|as the years have gone by. And I would say
../input/wav/16615.wav|because he either doesn't understand it, doesn't care or both.
../input/wav/16616.wav|suddenly walking away from the WHO and cutting off
../input/wav/16617.wav|as a central clearing house of information
../input/wav/16619.wav|of Trump seeing something that involves shared sacrifice,
../input/wav/16620.wav|conducting investigations and releasing information
../input/wav/16621.wav|if the coronavirus has shown us anything,
../input/wav/16622.wav|to the public.
../input/wav/16623.wav|Also, for what it's worth, it's not like it was alone
../input/wav/16624.wav|but everyone likes the way it works now
../input/wav/16625.wav|which you absolutely never should,
../input/wav/16626.wav|And that a serious unit of measurement.
../input/wav/16627.wav|Among them, that during the Ebola outbreak in,
../input/wav/16628.wav|and hated you?"
../input/wav/16629.wav|And given that we're now on track to leave
../input/wav/16630.wav|And more to the point, why would we ever consider
../input/wav/16631.wav|Okay, the WHO is not literally a pipe organ for China,
../input/wav/16633.wav|That's basic orgy management.
../input/wav/16634.wav|not everything that rhymes is true. Here, I'll show you.
../input/wav/16635.wav|runs on the same budget as Typhoon Lagoon at Disneyworld.
../input/wav/16636.wav|But it's rooted in how the WHO is funded
../input/wav/16637.wav|and an ongoing Ebola outbreak.
../input/wav/16638.wav|Trump is joining the ranks of...
../input/wav/16639.wav|past performance is really the issue here.
../input/wav/16640.wav|incredibly important that hinges on this election.
../input/wav/16641.wav|but it's also kind of important.
../input/wav/16642.wav|doing to polio what it did to smallpox and eliminating it.
../input/wav/16643.wav|It's like finding out the U.S. Navy
../input/wav/16644.wav|insulate ourselves from the rest of the world,
../input/wav/16645.wav|invaded a nation or funded a coup.
../input/wav/16646.wav|that this was the worst decision of the Reagan White House
../input/wav/16647.wav|It's mostly because we choose to
../input/wav/16648.wav|including Monkeypox, Yellow Fever,
../input/wav/16649.wav|And you could argue that this is a dumb way
../input/wav/16650.wav|to leave the WHO on July th of next year
../input/wav/16651.wav|over, Americans and a million people
../input/wav/16652.wav|That's where a country donates money,
../input/wav/16653.wav|best described as "What if trees got periods
../input/wav/16654.wav|But the solution clearly isn't to walk away.
../input/wav/16655.wav|And that's why she's the best, you pound the pavement.
../input/wav/16656.wav|And it's equally as missed.
../input/wav/16658.wav|for many, many reasons.
../input/wav/16659.wav|into real action.
../input/wav/16660.wav|to China's insistence that Taiwan not be allowed
../input/wav/16661.wav|Hashtag Team Chrishell.
../input/wav/16663.wav|...which I have to assume was written by someone
../input/wav/16664.wav|I'm not sure if Typhoon Lagoon's budget is way too high,
../input/wav/16665.wav|citing its bold approach to contain
../input/wav/16666.wav|and we're about to just give that up.
../input/wav/16667.wav|between what the U.S. and China give to the WHO.
../input/wav/16668.wav|we're going through right now, Trump has decided to withdraw
../input/wav/16669.wav|but it is important to remember
../input/wav/16670.wav|in Africa and... ...to global eradication
../input/wav/16671.wav|but those can't be the only options.
../input/wav/16672.wav|It has problems.
../input/wav/16673.wav|around the world, is one of the most ill-advised
../input/wav/16674.wav|all the way down to zero.
../input/wav/16676.wav|that we just simply pay too much to the WHO
../input/wav/16677.wav|I don't know where Chrishell hustles more,
../input/wav/16678.wav|which passed a resolution decades ago
../input/wav/16679.wav|And let's start with what the WHO does.
../input/wav/16680.wav|It's taking the fire engines away in
../input/wav/16681.wav|It's not even a great perspective at an orgy.
../input/wav/16682.wav|Except, I'm totally kidding, spare no thoughts for her,
../input/wav/16683.wav|and decides to just blow it up
../input/wav/16684.wav|from ten million cases and two million deaths a year,
../input/wav/16685.wav|for this show.
../input/wav/16686.wav|trade-offs, and complexity
../input/wav/16688.wav|That can be true. For instance,
../input/wav/16689.wav|specifying, we actually can withdraw
../input/wav/16690.wav|and the close relationship he claims the two have.
../input/wav/16691.wav|of the global polio eradication initiative,
../input/wav/16692.wav|That's remarkable! It's only a few more houses
../input/wav/16694.wav|in the past, with perhaps its most notable success
../input/wav/16695.wav|Someone's got to disinfect the coffee afterwards.
../input/wav/16696.wav|He stood on a boat and pushed as hard as he could.
../input/wav/16697.wav|and his alternative might be actively dangerous.
../input/wav/16698.wav|But the only way for the U.S. to have a say
../input/wav/16699.wav|because the WHO is underfunded because of something we did.
../input/wav/16700.wav|the rapid spread of the coronavirus,
../input/wav/16701.wav|the WHO in less than a year, tonight, let's talk about
../input/wav/16702.wav|the U.S. has a checkered past.
../input/wav/16703.wav|more and more voluntary donations
../input/wav/16704.wav|And let's start with the allegation
../input/wav/16705.wav|because the fact is we're currently on track
../input/wav/16707.wav|that country allows it to.
../input/wav/16708.wav|I can't say I'd be entirely surprised.
../input/wav/16709.wav|fighting diseases, developing policy,
../input/wav/16711.wav|And the first is how much of its budget the U.S. pays.
../input/wav/16712.wav|And never forget that she did once say,
../input/wav/16713.wav|So the clock is ticking here.
../input/wav/16714.wav|it's more complicated than that, and it is. The problem is
../input/wav/16715.wav|it's managed to do some incredible things
../input/wav/16717.wav|Trump praised China's response so many times,
../input/wav/16718.wav|of the flu virus should go into the annual flu shot.
../input/wav/16720.wav|Trump is uncapable of acknowledging nuance.
../input/wav/16721.wav|as one of the president's favorite punching bags.
../input/wav/16722.wav|And that is a pretty weird perk for America alone to have.
../input/wav/16724.wav|As one former U.S. representative
../input/wav/16725.wav|The good news is the WHO's constitution doesn't include
../input/wav/16726.wav|of. billion dollars a year.
../input/wav/16727.wav|it costs to run a single U.S. hospital,
../input/wav/16728.wav|and we're only as strong as our worst prepared country.
../input/wav/16729.wav|But there is no evidence at all this was done to appease China
../input/wav/16730.wav|trickle-down economics, and failing to publicly say
../input/wav/16731.wav|I'm not saying everything is Reagan's fault.
../input/wav/16732.wav|at the worst possible time.
../input/wav/16733.wav|The point is, in the midst of everything
../input/wav/16735.wav|we should still probably try to prevent that from happening.
../input/wav/16736.wav|And when, let's say hypothetically,
../input/wav/16737.wav|One of the biggest powers it has is the ability to declare
../input/wav/16739.wav|paid just million. That is a striking disparity.
../input/wav/16740.wav|And most of what the U.S. pays each year
../input/wav/16741.wav|which killed million people in the th century alone.
../input/wav/16742.wav|to that rule, and it's the United States,
../input/wav/16743.wav|And while it feels almost inappropriate for polio not to make a comeback
../input/wav/16744.wav|But the WHO's work isn't always as lofty
../input/wav/16745.wav|from the people living at his compound.
../input/wav/16746.wav|have hammered hard.
../input/wav/16748.wav|In, James Comer was up to no good.
../input/wav/16749.wav|that the WHO is deferential to China.
../input/wav/16750.wav|There are legitimate criticisms of how it's behaved in the past.
../input/wav/16751.wav|unable to go up, the WHO has naturally needed
../input/wav/16752.wav|Not only did they have to arrange a collaboration
../input/wav/16753.wav|that murder hornets are only here
../input/wav/16754.wav|And it is not like we're gonna make friends by
../input/wav/16755.wav|mishandled the pandemic because they're deferential to China.
../input/wav/16756.wav|Because our main story concerns the World Health Organization,
../input/wav/16757.wav|Smallpox is basically the Circuit City
../input/wav/16758.wav|Also when it comes to global health,
../input/wav/16759.wav|but in doing so, can earmark
../input/wav/16760.wav|in the effort explain what it took.
../input/wav/16761.wav|It's like finding out we demanded to be
../input/wav/16763.wav|And WHO leadership praised China early in this pandemic,
../input/wav/16764.wav|And that's how James Comer killed Natalie Wood.
../input/wav/16766.wav|Tonight, I'd like to talk about something
../input/wav/16767.wav|for the same reason nobody's looking for
../input/wav/16768.wav|Now, what is true in Trump's argument there
../input/wav/16770.wav|Someone's gotta make sure everyone's staying hydrated.
../input/wav/16771.wav|a technical term here, not know the fuck is going on.
../input/wav/16772.wav|You may already be aware of it in its role
../input/wav/16773.wav|...which of course they're not.
../input/wav/16774.wav|any provisions for members to withdraw.
../input/wav/16775.wav|and improving access to care.
../input/wav/16776.wav|That is a fantastic rhyme. No questions there.
../input/wav/16777.wav|is that there is a big discrepancy
../input/wav/16778.wav|at s levels. So, with those contributions
../input/wav/16779.wav|And while there is some truth is each half of that statement,
../input/wav/16780.wav|or you're getting fucked.
../input/wav/16783.wav|Someone's gotta be available to tip
../input/wav/16784.wav|with China and he said this
../input/wav/16785.wav|for TIME magazine's very realistical "Top Comas."
../input/wav/16786.wav|And it's amazing that something can go from being
../input/wav/16787.wav|because he started breeding them in,
../input/wav/16788.wav|Politico made it into an actual listicle.
../input/wav/16790.wav|or choosing to edit Kevin Spacey into a movie
../input/wav/16791.wav|and that money suddenly disappearing
../input/wav/16792.wav|of the coronavirus onto the WHO, China,
../input/wav/16793.wav|the pizza delivery person.
../input/wav/16794.wav|for shockingly little money,
../input/wav/16795.wav|that the WHO is a literal pipe organ for China,
../input/wav/16797.wav|but especially in the midst of a pandemic that's killed
../input/wav/16798.wav|"Who gives a fuck about Christmas stuff
../input/wav/16800.wav|of the seasonal flu vaccine.
../input/wav/16802.wav|to member states.
../input/wav/16803.wav|Before the killing of Bin Laden, one of the ways
../input/wav/16804.wav|of indoor airborne transmission.
../input/wav/16805.wav|and that China is calling all of the shots there.
../input/wav/16807.wav|they acted too slowly to declare a public health emergency,
../input/wav/16808.wav|they're not true together.
../input/wav/16809.wav|another country for a public health mission,
../input/wav/16811.wav|is voluntary contributions,
../input/wav/16812.wav|He's already submitted a notice of withdrawal to the UN,
../input/wav/16813.wav|and the Iran nuclear deal, and now he's doing it with
../input/wav/16814.wav|to take effect next July.
../input/wav/16815.wav|the middle of fighting the fire or getting rid of the lifeboats
../input/wav/16816.wav|he would argue the U.S. could go it alone.
../input/wav/16817.wav|which is wild!
../input/wav/16818.wav|Incidentally, making them eligible
../input/wav/16819.wav|all over the world to determine what strains
../input/wav/16820.wav|Nobody wants a U.S. based alternative here
../input/wav/16821.wav|And look, it is fine if the U.S. has problems with the WHO.
../input/wav/16822.wav|it is important to remember that WHO needs to be
../input/wav/16823.wav|yet another important thing on the ballot this year.
../input/wav/16824.wav|Back in February, Trump was working out a trade deal
../input/wav/16825.wav|which had major consequences. But the truth is for Trump,
../input/wav/16826.wav|was by staging a fake vaccination campaign
../input/wav/16827.wav|to enforce those recommendations.
../input/wav/16828.wav|which is not to say that it is perfect.
../input/wav/16829.wav|whereas China chooses to pay almost nothing.
../input/wav/16830.wav|that you agree with the president,
../input/wav/16832.wav|Almost all of the rest comes through voluntary contributions.
../input/wav/16833.wav|The question then becomes, what then?
../input/wav/16835.wav|including alerting the world to threats,
../input/wav/16836.wav|the only country allowed to wax the pubes of every squirrel.
../input/wav/16837.wav|after giving one year's notice.
../input/wav/16838.wav|just weeks before its release date.
../input/wav/16839.wav|And it's not like the WHO did this with a magic wand.
../input/wav/16840.wav|it's that diseases don't recognize borders
../input/wav/16841.wav|Especially having seen the way that we've handled
../input/wav/16842.wav|It arguably took too long to advise universal mask wearing
../input/wav/16843.wav|We've seen this with the Paris Climate Agreement
../input/wav/16844.wav|Now, what they're essentially arguing there is the WHO
../input/wav/16845.wav|Twice a year, it convenes representatives from
../input/wav/16846.wav|It took a huge amount of work.
../input/wav/16847.wav|or the Navy's is way too low,
../input/wav/16848.wav|And pulling out of the WHO at any time,
../input/wav/16851.wav|It was founded in, and has since grown
../input/wav/16852.wav|In the space of a decade, it took smallpox
../input/wav/16853.wav|So, at its best, the WHO does vitally important work
../input/wav/16854.wav|of its funding comes through accessed contributions,
../input/wav/16855.wav|Something which not only put health workers in the region
../input/wav/16856.wav|It's to try and fix them.
../input/wav/16857.wav|And for the briefest of moments, felt hope.
../input/wav/16859.wav|And issue recommendations on how countries should respond.
../input/wav/16861.wav|but do spare a thought there for Melania,
../input/wav/16862.wav|That is an idea that he and his supporters
../input/wav/16864.wav|because the WHO has never, you know,
../input/wav/16866.wav|Now, that is very bad news,
../input/wav/16867.wav|is almost impossible to get your head around.
../input/wav/16868.wav|As one official puts it, the U.S. decision to leave
../input/wav/16869.wav|to deflect blame for his handling
../input/wav/16872.wav|The U.S. cannot do what the WHO does
../input/wav/16873.wav|Some of its most important work involves the development
../input/wav/16874.wav|But I do have to accept that it might be untrue.
../input/wav/16876.wav|and decorations?"
../input/wav/16877.wav|Okay, now, I know that rhyme sounded compelling,
../input/wav/16878.wav|In, the U.S. paid just over million dollars,
../input/wav/16879.wav|this whole mess is almost entirely America's fault.
../input/wav/16880.wav|which are basically membership dues based on
../input/wav/16881.wav|It can only act within a country to the extent
../input/wav/16882.wav|Over the last six months, Trump has consistently tried
../input/wav/16884.wav|Which might sound tedious, because it is,
../input/wav/16885.wav|And this is incredibly dangerous
../input/wav/16886.wav|So, what about Trump's second big complaint,
../input/wav/16887.wav|exactly what they want it used for.
../input/wav/16889.wav|they're perfectly fine for a child
../input/wav/16890.wav|supreme what is white supremacy can
../input/wav/16891.wav|careful how much time you spend on their
../input/wav/16894.wav|that's all down to their natural and
../input/wav/16896.wav|like how exactly is diversity our
../input/wav/16897.wav|while white supremacy is clearly
../input/wav/16898.wav|implying that the answer to those
../input/wav/16899.wav|prestigious universities and
../input/wav/16901.wav|ten fingers and toes a pointy face with
../input/wav/16903.wav|power is now tucker's signature move he
../input/wav/16904.wav|hannah barbera animator who can't draw
../input/wav/16907.wav|humble tv dinner princeling somehow
../input/wav/16908.wav|it's a war with one side trying to erase
../input/wav/16909.wav|started stormfront
../input/wav/16910.wav|fascinating because it's not just a
../input/wav/16912.wav|like every week now tucker has another
../input/wav/16913.wav|hot take that is the essential tucker
../input/wav/16914.wav|represents is so dangerous let's start
../input/wav/16915.wav|reportedly after his father told him
../input/wav/16916.wav|how did you go from criticizing pat
../input/wav/16918.wav|talking about him where he came from
../input/wav/16919.wav|is buckley swanson peck carlson the only
../input/wav/16920.wav|sometimes just recaps tucker's segments
../input/wav/16922.wav|where white people are dominant
../input/wav/16923.wav|him they are not just censoring free
../input/wav/16924.wav|addition to utterly
../input/wav/16926.wav|for the love of the game now to hear
../input/wav/16928.wav|tucker has been endorsed
../input/wav/16930.wav|gives tuckers an even worse name than
../input/wav/16931.wav|watch it want to enjoy it and a second
../input/wav/16932.wav|white identity politics if he can
../input/wav/16933.wav|do it which might be
../input/wav/16937.wav|and that plea for understanding there is
../input/wav/16939.wav|when you know how tucker speaks when he
../input/wav/16940.wav|learning about bitcoin
../input/wav/16944.wav|incredibly close to it
../input/wav/16948.wav|a little pink rosebud mouth a cat sized
../input/wav/16949.wav|one more artifact of our outrage culture
../input/wav/16951.wav|if tucker's got sad s single man
../input/wav/16953.wav|in his time at cnn he did manage to
../input/wav/16954.wav|are you interested but despite his total
../input/wav/16955.wav|weird thing to say
../input/wav/16956.wav|things as a question like
../input/wav/16957.wav|less ethnic identities which is a pretty
../input/wav/16958.wav|we're not giving tucker any attention
../input/wav/16959.wav|that journalism
../input/wav/16960.wav|hashtag free brittany and while tucker
../input/wav/16962.wav|roundly condemned by the local clergy
../input/wav/16963.wav|that's quite a different tone and it is
../input/wav/16965.wav|is yes but when in turn anyone questions
../input/wav/16967.wav|don't just put on a tiny bow tie and
../input/wav/16969.wav|and a future for white children and when
../input/wav/16970.wav|always been that disciplined
../input/wav/16971.wav|whenever he tries to define it himself
../input/wav/16972.wav|masculinity of china's navy to his
../input/wav/16973.wav|when the niece of a byzantine emperor
../input/wav/16974.wav|lack of preparation tucker was almost
../input/wav/16975.wav|relevant and that in fact you
../input/wav/16976.wav|is too small either commit to it or
../input/wav/16978.wav|all too familiar cycle of condemnation
../input/wav/16979.wav|jolla california where his dad
../input/wav/16980.wav|rigged because they saw an increase in
../input/wav/16982.wav|to try and understand where the
../input/wav/16983.wav|islamophobe a troll
../input/wav/16984.wav|the common man is very selective take
../input/wav/16986.wav|president duke even suggested that
../input/wav/16989.wav|whenever this topic comes up he has the
../input/wav/16990.wav|supremacist cause like this
../input/wav/16991.wav|and again he will be careful not to
../input/wav/16992.wav|and he does seem to need one because
../input/wav/16994.wav|poorer dirtier and more divided and any
../input/wav/16997.wav|it tends to be self-servingly narrow
../input/wav/16998.wav|of the thing you just described and that
../input/wav/16999.wav|follows tucker every week as
../input/wav/17001.wav|says we must secure the existence of our
../input/wav/17002.wav|on her name tucker and of course
../input/wav/17003.wav|you put the two together
../input/wav/17004.wav|pretty much the same talking points
../input/wav/17007.wav|him say the n word as if that is the
../input/wav/17008.wav|the drew barrymore show first time for
../input/wav/17009.wav|if you go back and watch his early
../input/wav/17010.wav|oh off tucker you relentlessly
../input/wav/17013.wav|full refutation of tucker's lazy racism
../input/wav/17014.wav|doing groundbreaking shows like
../input/wav/17016.wav|spends percent of his time making the
../input/wav/17019.wav|actually incredibly consistent because
../input/wav/17020.wav|few years ago he lost advertisers after
../input/wav/17021.wav|millions of viewers a night watch him
../input/wav/17022.wav|tucker's framing off himself as the
../input/wav/17023.wav|not just that it isn't but that it's a
../input/wav/17024.wav|borrow a phrase a bit
../input/wav/17025.wav|and essential bedrock upon which all
../input/wav/17027.wav|i already know what tucker will say
../input/wav/17028.wav|and tucker conveniently for him doesn't
../input/wav/17030.wav|okay that isn't just incredibly
../input/wav/17032.wav|substitute artificial metal forks for
../input/wav/17034.wav|all tucker viewers know refers to when a
../input/wav/17035.wav|and what he seemed to hear because
../input/wav/17036.wav|often call to resist that threat
../input/wav/17037.wav|the single whitest origin story i have
../input/wav/17038.wav|seem to be big fans of what tucker's
../input/wav/17040.wav|carlson experience because
../input/wav/17042.wav|eclipse you can see him learning the
../input/wav/17043.wav|years because here is one of his very
../input/wav/17044.wav|to basically imitating him it's all to
../input/wav/17045.wav|leave britney alone don't do gotcha
../input/wav/17046.wav|like a high bar to clear for a man who
../input/wav/17047.wav|the most clip of all time you work
../input/wav/17048.wav|looking for somebody to talk about the
../input/wav/17049.wav|tucker set off a bit of a firestorm
../input/wav/17050.wav|start dating the headmaster's daughter a
../input/wav/17051.wav|tucker is right and can't cuck the tuck
../input/wav/17055.wav|they watch tucker the same way i watch
../input/wav/17057.wav|that the big existential threat to
../input/wav/17058.wav|is okay first very clear language seems
../input/wav/17059.wav|of any situation where they aren't in
../input/wav/17062.wav|and any effort to change that is an
../input/wav/17064.wav|outraged wedge salad
../input/wav/17068.wav|specific bow tie because look
../input/wav/17069.wav|what his tactics are and why what he
../input/wav/17071.wav|nothing like the one he grew up in
../input/wav/17075.wav|going to give tucker a pretty clear
../input/wav/17076.wav|maternity flight suits pregnant women
../input/wav/17077.wav|for color blindness
../input/wav/17078.wav|of which is really just a long way of
../input/wav/17079.wav|someone who has almost forgotten what
../input/wav/17082.wav|he'll build in deniability by phrasing
../input/wav/17086.wav|jailed economically exploited or indeed
../input/wav/17087.wav|do get the message although to be fair
../input/wav/17088.wav|and your ethnic identity can best be
../input/wav/17090.wav|tucker carlson should be his vp
../input/wav/17091.wav|is a pretty weak argument he's like
../input/wav/17093.wav|to last summer's black lives matter
../input/wav/17094.wav|and if he can sell his audience on his
../input/wav/17095.wav|on cable he averages over three million
../input/wav/17096.wav|therefore it is an insult to him to
../input/wav/17097.wav|are you talking about you performatively
../input/wav/17098.wav|entire glass of wine on a screen in the
../input/wav/17099.wav|that what tucker is saying is
../input/wav/17100.wav|last week it was the dr seuss
../input/wav/17101.wav|for long months now i'm so desperate
../input/wav/17103.wav|your advice is
../input/wav/17105.wav|that certain races are more deserving of
../input/wav/17109.wav|natural forks his fingers
../input/wav/17111.wav|been doing just listen to derek black
../input/wav/17112.wav|sincere apologies you tiny little
../input/wav/17113.wav|guy's family
../input/wav/17114.wav|the largest oldest white supremacist
../input/wav/17116.wav|from the night before
../input/wav/17117.wav|should america be selective with
../input/wav/17119.wav|so i can't be a white supremacist
../input/wav/17120.wav|i can't be a sexual predator because i
../input/wav/17121.wav|first tv appearances in the aftermath of
../input/wav/17122.wav|it's also the kind of fact-free cultural
../input/wav/17125.wav|centuries later in fact
../input/wav/17127.wav|demonstrators were coming from
../input/wav/17128.wav|more dangerous when it isn't
../input/wav/17129.wav|all the time whenever he's criticized a
../input/wav/17132.wav|boarding school where he promptly did
../input/wav/17133.wav|god in his wisdom has provided man with
../input/wav/17138.wav|buchanan for that precise tactic
../input/wav/17139.wav|and if you think well come on
../input/wav/17141.wav|we've got an extra career lying around
../input/wav/17143.wav|become anti-white and anti-male
../input/wav/17144.wav|speech they are launching an attack
../input/wav/17145.wav|absolute heart of tucker's show so often
../input/wav/17146.wav|how easily can you sunburn and look my
../input/wav/17147.wav|not only has she been through a lot
../input/wav/17149.wav|they thought that because people like
../input/wav/17150.wav|innate abilities
../input/wav/17151.wav|clippy it's turning you into an
../input/wav/17152.wav|it's the idea that this country is
../input/wav/17153.wav|actually experiencing racism although
../input/wav/17154.wav|if your full name is tucker swanson
../input/wav/17155.wav|tucker's lead to tv though came as an
../input/wav/17156.wav|one of the most dangerous is that he is
../input/wav/17157.wav|his viewers are the ones currently being
../input/wav/17158.wav|comments sparked an
../input/wav/17159.wav|for doing that no
../input/wav/17161.wav|brought a case of forks to venice for
../input/wav/17163.wav|once and once
../input/wav/17165.wav|share his definition that it must
../input/wav/17166.wav|through a lot of comparisons to the
../input/wav/17170.wav|let's just consider the vast distance
../input/wav/17172.wav|which is obviously a good idea those
../input/wav/17173.wav|asking the hard questions the ones that
../input/wav/17175.wav|the sphinx territory here
../input/wav/17176.wav|now as a child tucker was sent to
../input/wav/17177.wav|on the foundations of our democracy and
../input/wav/17178.wav|human laughter sounds like i've been
../input/wav/17179.wav|next the problem is
../input/wav/17180.wav|something she said if
../input/wav/17182.wav|for tucker on that question is
../input/wav/17184.wav|what is white supremacy the answer is
../input/wav/17185.wav|vastly different ways is that he's
../input/wav/17187.wav|and the most telling thing about
../input/wav/17188.wav|attempt to change that culture
../input/wav/17189.wav|tucker said that he deplored the
../input/wav/17191.wav|walls of a hotel ballroom
../input/wav/17192.wav|criminal mobs who destroy what the rest
../input/wav/17193.wav|now of course clippy has been asking
../input/wav/17194.wav|neo-nazi chuckle ping-ponging off the
../input/wav/17195.wav|while stanley tucci quietly drinks an
../input/wav/17196.wav|but when you put all of this together
../input/wav/17197.wav|immigrants and has the democratic party
../input/wav/17198.wav|scourge of the elites and the
../input/wav/17200.wav|scrunching his face up for an hour every
../input/wav/17201.wav|like is affirmative action racist and
../input/wav/17202.wav|is already enough there in the
../input/wav/17203.wav|better time he once wishfully claimed
../input/wav/17205.wav|so it's frankly no wonder that that
../input/wav/17207.wav|immigrants make our country
../input/wav/17208.wav|gather around to watch tucker twice the
../input/wav/17209.wav|the immigrants make our country poorer
../input/wav/17211.wav|fox show in. the fascinating thing
../input/wav/17213.wav|our main story tonight concerns i'm
../input/wav/17215.wav|we thought tonight it would be worth
../input/wav/17220.wav|you repeatedly told them the election
../input/wav/17223.wav|that violin hook from toxic comes on
../input/wav/17224.wav|in both instances
../input/wav/17226.wav|they saw the radical increase in mail-in
../input/wav/17227.wav|last year when endorsing trump for
../input/wav/17229.wav|retirees and their sad imprisoned pets
../input/wav/17230.wav|country looks nothing like the country i
../input/wav/17231.wav|but i want to learn you're advancing
../input/wav/17232.wav|denied access to health care after their
../input/wav/17234.wav|veil covering his racism would
../input/wav/17239.wav|should be terrified of the idea
../input/wav/17240.wav|code it's a walking yacht club
../input/wav/17241.wav|by white supremacists james alsup a
../input/wav/17243.wav|you his viewer
../input/wav/17244.wav|potential future presidential candidate
../input/wav/17245.wav|which should be seriously alarming
../input/wav/17246.wav|pretty salient point there it's just
../input/wav/17247.wav|about this because
../input/wav/17249.wav|what does racism look like what kind of
../input/wav/17251.wav|once said this to a conference room full
../input/wav/17253.wav|duke even has a podcast where he
../input/wav/17255.wav|first i'm so sorry tucker i honestly
../input/wav/17257.wav|affront to the natural order of things
../input/wav/17258.wav|accident supposedly
../input/wav/17259.wav|america right now is diversity
../input/wav/17261.wav|for her decadence with one saying
../input/wav/17263.wav|the o.j verdict
../input/wav/17264.wav|explaining tucker's value to the white
../input/wav/17265.wav|why give him the attention that he's so
../input/wav/17267.wav|duke's podcast and think hey
../input/wav/17269.wav|threat to our existence
../input/wav/17270.wav|civilization is somehow both the mighty
../input/wav/17271.wav|journalism about her pepsi consumption
../input/wav/17272.wav|they don't contribute to the common good
../input/wav/17273.wav|race and civilization like he's calling
../input/wav/17275.wav|most people barely had last names much
../input/wav/17276.wav|used to call into a radio show hosted by
../input/wav/17277.wav|i'm just saying if you typed tucker's
../input/wav/17278.wav|there is more than one way to be a
../input/wav/17281.wav|and look i would like nothing more
../input/wav/17284.wav|i do want to quickly come back to that
../input/wav/17285.wav|life because she was granted asylum when
../input/wav/17287.wav|black or white he'll insist that he's
../input/wav/17288.wav|offensive stick you might even be
../input/wav/17290.wav|they are expanding tucker's presence
../input/wav/17291.wav|and there is real harm in that because
../input/wav/17295.wav|the world for his audience becomes
../input/wav/17298.wav|and facet of that very same system yeah
../input/wav/17299.wav|tucker can't be racist i've never heard
../input/wav/17302.wav|now from there tucker bounced around a
../input/wav/17306.wav|and it does seem like the dividing line
../input/wav/17307.wav|tucker's also been floated as a
../input/wav/17308.wav|that it's a belief that in a country
../input/wav/17310.wav|hero of the common man is that for
../input/wav/17313.wav|dangerous when
../input/wav/17315.wav|credit did kind of turn out to be true
../input/wav/17316.wav|definition of white supremacy later in

../input/wav/17383.wav|while it is clearly by no means the most
../input/wav/17384.wav|point about how systemic oppression is
../input/wav/17385.wav|is that power is being taken away from
../input/wav/17386.wav|gun safety and overall life choices
../input/wav/17387.wav|his clear takeaway is that white people
../input/wav/17388.wav|with some backstory tucker grew up in la

../input/wav/17394.wav|because of all the things that tucker is

../input/wav/17409.wav|trump was president and also

../input/wav/17412.wav|you might even have friends who think

../input/wav/17466.wav|especially not when this is what he said
../input/wav/17467.wav|is an attack on western civilization all

../input/wav/17470.wav|it's not like it's written in a complex

../input/wav/17486.wav|sorry to say tucker carlson a man who
../input/wav/17488.wav|people didn't think the election was

../input/wav/17491.wav|david duke he's not only tweeted
../input/wav/17493.wav|she was a child but
../input/wav/17495.wav|didn't realize that your show was

../input/wav/17506.wav|in fact his pre-written caption there we
../input/wav/17508.wav|i'm not a white supremacist but
../input/wav/17509.wav|hope that no one notices
../input/wav/17511.wav|quote into a blank word document

../input/wav/17515.wav|watches tucker twice a night of course
../input/wav/17516.wav|he then became a print journalist
../input/wav/17517.wav|now he's packed a lot in there from

../input/wav/17531.wav|yeah for tucker it seems western
../input/wav/17533.wav|i have ever heard and i say that as

../input/wav/17566.wav|i'm not taking it from you because the
../input/wav/17567.wav|especially hard to take
../input/wav/17569.wav|dinner fortune which is already
../input/wav/17571.wav|did he inadvertently make a nuanced
../input/wav/17574.wav|attending his first communion or a
../input/wav/17575.wav|when you contrast it with how he reacted
../input/wav/17576.wav|concept in my southern california
../input/wav/17577.wav|the era of millions of your relatives
../input/wav/17578.wav|being on earth who doesn't perk up when
../input/wav/17579.wav|isn't that tucker is inconsistent in
../input/wav/17582.wav|this piece
../input/wav/17583.wav|hey you yeah you with the skin and face
../input/wav/17586.wav|completely misplaced outrage at joe
../input/wav/17587.wav|means dismantling the entire american

../input/wav/17594.wav|are you trying to recite the words
../input/wav/17596.wav|and i promise that we we're actually
../input/wav/17597.wav|body a long weird tail and i eat garbage
../input/wav/17598.wav|stuck inside casper's
../input/wav/17601.wav|promoted by self-avowed white
../input/wav/17602.wav|i certainly never intended for them to
../input/wav/17603.wav|he's not already getting a lot of
../input/wav/17604.wav|according to tucker dismantling the
../input/wav/17606.wav|saying that when tucker asks
../input/wav/17607.wav|interesting to see who gets to be
../input/wav/17608.wav|into a love sponge's radio show in
../input/wav/17609.wav|remarks he was the most watched show
../input/wav/17610.wav|and i guarantee you there is not a human
../input/wav/17611.wav|eventually fell upwards into a primetime
../input/wav/17612.wav|somehow still isn't enough
../input/wav/17613.wav|run segments just asking questions
../input/wav/17614.wav|terrible pillows is very seductive
../input/wav/17615.wav|staffed entirely by children
../input/wav/17617.wav|co-workers and elected officials
../input/wav/17619.wav|is to dismiss the controversy that
../input/wav/17620.wav|long-form documentary series and if that
../input/wav/17622.wav|and more divided and this is how he
../input/wav/17624.wav|culture you should know that he hasn't
../input/wav/17625.wav|but he will occasionally dance
../input/wav/17627.wav|famous white supremacist slogan that
../input/wav/17628.wav|than to not play into his wildly
../input/wav/17629.wav|literally explode from hearing someone
../input/wav/17630.wav|economy and system of government now
../input/wav/17632.wav|more ethnically white is if he
../input/wav/17633.wav|tucker who constitutes
../input/wav/17634.wav|allowed what his preferred solutions to
../input/wav/17636.wav|back in the s dan rather show called
../input/wav/17637.wav|the magazine where tucker was working
../input/wav/17638.wav|defensiveness and hype and it seems
../input/wav/17639.wav|the filter through which he processes
../input/wav/17640.wav|interesting because
../input/wav/17645.wav|less worthy of respect he will just
../input/wav/17646.wav|the night he made those flight suit
../input/wav/17648.wav|depending on who he's talking about take
../input/wav/17651.wav|tag that says hello my name is a racist
../input/wav/17652.wav|about pat buchanan the republican
../input/wav/17654.wav|moves with the precision of a dedicated
../input/wav/17656.wav|heavily imply that
../input/wav/17657.wav|oh that might be the single worst laugh
../input/wav/17658.wav|of a live audience but if it is a
../input/wav/17659.wav|there is you know a slight similarity
../input/wav/17661.wav|burning crosses clan hoods and a name
../input/wav/17662.wav|racial solidarity wasn't a working
../input/wav/17664.wav|about his messaging in the late s he
../input/wav/17665.wav|she's a stone cold legend
../input/wav/17667.wav|and while it's bad enough to hear that
../input/wav/17668.wav|than have been killed
../input/wav/17670.wav|painfully apparent because he is smart
../input/wav/17673.wav|tucker tell it he grew up in a simpler
../input/wav/17674.wav|and all of this is why as tempting as it
../input/wav/17675.wav|so given that tucker has the admiration
../input/wav/17676.wav|fail to impress any number of
../input/wav/17678.wav|is direct
../input/wav/17679.wav|with an interesting choice of phrase
../input/wav/17681.wav|power the main narrative of tucker show
../input/wav/17685.wav|regular pepsi look i cannot stress this
../input/wav/17689.wav|does that make me a possum
../input/wav/17691.wav|he is scared of a country that looks
../input/wav/17693.wav|to hear the response
../input/wav/17695.wav|a conspiracy theorist a misogynist
../input/wav/17696.wav|incredibly hard to take
../input/wav/17698.wav|everyone else is still at lunch can you
../input/wav/17701.wav|are less terrified of being belittled
../input/wav/17704.wav|'Cause at this point, Trump is clearly bored
../input/wav/17705.wav|specifically preparation, coordination, and communication.
../input/wav/17707.wav|they'll never abandon you even if you're
../input/wav/17708.wav|are inflating coronavirus death counts for money.
../input/wav/17709.wav|And when he finally did that,
../input/wav/17710.wav|he's been borderline sociopathic.
../input/wav/17711.wav|"Oh, Trump must be great for you comedians, right?"
../input/wav/17712.wav|mass-community spread. And one of the best ways
../input/wav/17714.wav|could help cure the virus.
../input/wav/17715.wav|that that alone sounds good, but it really does.
../input/wav/17716.wav|but it is worth making sure that that still does.
../input/wav/17717.wav|which is useless if you don't then use it wisely,
../input/wav/17718.wav|and right in the middle for no good reason
../input/wav/17719.wav|he knew extremely early on just how bad things could get.
../input/wav/17720.wav|which his people then tried to pass off as him kidding,
../input/wav/17721.wav|Then, Trump continually implied the virus would simply go away
../input/wav/17722.wav|definitely built Pinnochio for weird sex stuff.
../input/wav/17723.wav|to believe that nothing more could have been done,
../input/wav/17724.wav|That really doesn't sound good.
../input/wav/17725.wav|Like puppies are good and Geppetto
../input/wav/17726.wav|Okay, first,
../input/wav/17727.wav|to still come into the country from China,
../input/wav/17728.wav|Trump apparently interrupted him to ask
../input/wav/17729.wav|And the thing is, one of the best ways
../input/wav/17730.wav|to use travel restrictions,
../input/wav/17731.wav|impose some travel restrictions on China,
../input/wav/17733.wav|to do it yourself. It is why Soul Cycle instructors
../input/wav/17734.wav|when so many Americans are still dying
../input/wav/17735.wav|is not allowed to fuck the puppet he made
../input/wav/17736.wav|have been aware of a threat like this for years.
../input/wav/17737.wav|actively killing them." And he'd go, "Okay,
../input/wav/17739.wav|anything with anyone, which incidentally is still true
../input/wav/17740.wav|that makes your soul jump out of your body.
../input/wav/17741.wav|which should be the hardest to do badly,
../input/wav/17742.wav|for anything Trump does to shock you anymore,
../input/wav/17743.wav|and in January, seeing what was coming our way,
../input/wav/17745.wav|so he could offer everyone pens. Pens!
../input/wav/17746.wav|it would be worth taking a look at three crucial areas
../input/wav/17747.wav|I mean, I guess that depends, doesn't it?
../input/wav/17748.wav|And look, if Biden is elected, it's not like he's gonna
../input/wav/17749.wav|overseeing two trillion dollars in COVID relief.
../input/wav/17750.wav|meant that suddenly, and entirely avoidable,
../input/wav/17751.wav|during the first two months that his "ban" was in place.
../input/wav/17752.wav|for something called, the supply chain taskforce.
../input/wav/17753.wav|and also, after other countries
../input/wav/17754.wav|Which brings us to our final point here,
../input/wav/17755.wav|So, previous presidents were well aware
../input/wav/17756.wav|he is my son." You'd have exactly two thoughts,
../input/wav/17758.wav|about percent of global cases.
../input/wav/17760.wav|That really should not be a surprise,
../input/wav/17763.wav|And if you're thinking, "Oh, come on.
../input/wav/17768.wav|to safely process them, with some passengers reporting
../input/wav/17769.wav|when you're hungry. Go buy some fucking food.
../input/wav/17770.wav|which actually brings us to our second point coordination.
../input/wav/17771.wav|Because that man was in the middle of talking
../input/wav/17772.wav|"Happy th, Gammy. Try to stay safe."
../input/wav/17774.wav|Because if it's the second one, you may actually be right.
../input/wav/17775.wav|There are long-term and devastating effects
../input/wav/17776.wav|He wasn't even listening. He was just sitting there,
../input/wav/17778.wav|But you know what's been completely exhausting
../input/wav/17779.wav|on the show this year, but we still thought
../input/wav/17780.wav|because the best they can do is delay a pandemic,
../input/wav/17781.wav|"sporadic for you, not sporadic for other people"
../input/wav/17783.wav|rushed into airports that were not adequately prepared
../input/wav/17784.wav|The guy whose house sounds like a bomb
../input/wav/17785.wav|and I actually did pretty well."
../input/wav/17786.wav|a pandemic response plan all the way back in,
../input/wav/17787.wav|with thousands of their closest friends
../input/wav/17788.wav|but would that have been worse? Better?
../input/wav/17791.wav|to which he responded, "I don't kid."
../input/wav/17793.wav|And just like that, wearing a mask
../input/wav/17794.wav|is that once we found out about it,
../input/wav/17795.wav|would have resource-management experience
../input/wav/17797.wav|undercut it, in the very press conference
../input/wav/17799.wav|about what needed to happen. He told government contacts
../input/wav/17801.wav|And here is one of them describing what happened
../input/wav/17802.wav|or the best that he can?
../input/wav/17803.wav|to place any restrictions on travelers from there.
../input/wav/17804.wav|Look, believe me,
../input/wav/17805.wav|At one point, it tried to coordinate things directly
../input/wav/17806.wav|be right, be credible, express empathy, promote action,
../input/wav/17807.wav|not to run short on PPE is to not have
../input/wav/17808.wav|just how badly this administration coordinated
../input/wav/17809.wav|that China took too long to be forthright with us
../input/wav/17810.wav|To repeatedly undermining the nation's top
../input/wav/17811.wav|after an initial pep talk about the importance
../input/wav/17812.wav|"Good news, this little wooden boy is Pinocchio,
../input/wav/17815.wav|came on December st, and yet Alex Azar,
../input/wav/17816.wav|at my friend Topher's house one night,
../input/wav/17818.wav|Also, we now know that the virus came to the New York City area
../input/wav/17819.wav|as Trump Immunity Juice.
../input/wav/17820.wav|And even once the pandemic had begun,
../input/wav/17821.wav|And this "ban" had some major exceptions,
../input/wav/17822.wav|And yet even as it became clear to everyone
../input/wav/17823.wav|Despite the fact that, as we now know,
../input/wav/17824.wav|Some medical professionals resorted to making their own
../input/wav/17826.wav|despite learning on February th
../input/wav/17828.wav|about his peer's PTSD, and the president cut him off
../input/wav/17830.wav|and this was unquestionably Trump's,

../input/wav/17833.wav|the Warriors are gonna blow a three-one lead to the Cavs,
../input/wav/17834.wav|But if you find the raw footage of that clip,

../input/wav/17836.wav|And the thing is, there are so many more
../input/wav/17837.wav|Which is obviously dangerous. You can't effectively convince
../input/wav/17838.wav|Bowen could not have been more explicit
../input/wav/17839.wav|is the literally definition of sporadic. And second,
../input/wav/17840.wav|and go, "Sir, a quarter-million Americans
../input/wav/17841.wav|a fucking nightmare.
../input/wav/17842.wav|were sick earlier this year, and it was heart-wrenching
../input/wav/17843.wav|broke down in video testimonials.
../input/wav/17844.wav|And I know that Trump badly wants everyone
../input/wav/17845.wav|In fact, we've talked about coronavirus a lot
../input/wav/17847.wav|Look, all presidents, whoever they are,
../input/wav/17848.wav|talking to a nurse practioner in the Oval Office.
../input/wav/17851.wav|I'm just saying I'm moving away from Geppetto."
../input/wav/17853.wav|than Germany, but times the COVID cases.
../input/wav/17854.wav|of every single one of those. And on the empathy one,
../input/wav/17855.wav|lots of it took place in New York,
../input/wav/17856.wav|when he is the president, surrounded by / security
../input/wav/17858.wav|people to do something while refusing
../input/wav/17859.wav|would allow him to ramp up production immediately.
../input/wav/17861.wav|which had predictable consequences.
../input/wav/17863.wav|Remember that time that he suggested we should leave
../input/wav/17865.wav|wasn't early, and didn't do what he said it did.
../input/wav/17866.wav|I would love nothing more than to not talk about COVID,
../input/wav/17867.wav|It was utterly brutal here. And with that in mind,
../input/wav/17869.wav|and gave a speech in December of
../input/wav/17872.wav|that most of the US mask supply now comes from abroad,
../input/wav/17873.wav|also thinks that "nothing more could have been done,"
../input/wav/17874.wav|Wow. Those are some shockingly specific predictions.
../input/wav/17875.wav|where he false made it sound like some Americans
../input/wav/17876.wav|Herman Cain." And he'd say, "Yeah,
../input/wav/17877.wav|or alpaca veterinarian malpractice.
../input/wav/17878.wav|ravaged with coronavirus because they'd increase
../input/wav/17879.wav|For years, he has been sounding the alarm
../input/wav/17881.wav|not really seeing what the warning's about here,
../input/wav/17882.wav|So, if you've lost a loved one to this virus,
../input/wav/17883.wav|it came in a chaotic Oval Office speech,
../input/wav/17885.wav|at the same time as almost everyone else on Earth.
../input/wav/17886.wav|he'd been president for three years
../input/wav/17887.wav|On April rd, the CDC finally advised
../input/wav/17888.wav|written down anywhere that says Geppetto
../input/wav/17889.wav|the downfall of society at age.
../input/wav/17890.wav|but, times the COVID cases.
../input/wav/17892.wav|there are massive fuck-ups you may have already forgotten.
../input/wav/17893.wav|they have to be part of a comprehensive plan
../input/wav/17894.wav|instead of just yelling, "Pedal faster,"
../input/wav/17895.wav|is going to be a significant factor in how they vote.
../input/wav/17896.wav|you don't know quite how to feel about.
../input/wav/17897.wav|This virus has taken so much from us.
../input/wav/17898.wav|despite what this Coke bottle tells you.
../input/wav/17899.wav|The truth is a lot of voters are more than willing
../input/wav/17900.wav|Is there anything more grim than that?
../input/wav/17901.wav|had we also not lost a month due to flaws in our testing process
../input/wav/17902.wav|And this was before most of us knew we shouldn't be sharing
../input/wav/17903.wav|that tonight, especially if you or someone you know
../input/wav/17904.wav|of "COVID! COVID!" every day.
../input/wav/17905.wav|when flavored vaping products would be back on the market,
../input/wav/17906.wav|you will see that the conversation they're having
../input/wav/17907.wav|"Well, he got the disease, so, you know..."
../input/wav/17908.wav|is Donald fucking Trump.
../input/wav/17910.wav|Trump's administration not only disbanded Obama's pandemic team,
../input/wav/17911.wav|can't see their families, and cases now spiking
../input/wav/17913.wav|Over a decade ago, the CDC actually developed
../input/wav/17914.wav|they had to scramble for essential equipment
../input/wav/17915.wav|untrained volunteers to help vet leads on PPE.
../input/wav/17918.wav|with Jared pulling in a group of mostly young,
../input/wav/17920.wav|there is still nothing in the cupboards,
../input/wav/17921.wav|he bans travel from China and job done.
../input/wav/17924.wav|and eating a bucket of hot wings.
../input/wav/17926.wav|In New York, hospitals had giant,
../input/wav/17927.wav|at age six. This guy created
../input/wav/17931.wav|What else did he say there?
../input/wav/17932.wav|to throw the opening pitch at a Nationals' game,
../input/wav/17933.wav|If you move into a new apartment and three years later,
../input/wav/17934.wav|guidelines for how leaders should communicate
../input/wav/17935.wav|of the global population and yet
../input/wav/17936.wav|A-plus, and said, 'Nothing more could have been done,'"
../input/wav/17937.wav|meaning an additional, people came in from there
../input/wav/17938.wav|But a few things about that, because while he did indeed
../input/wav/17939.wav|He will often complain, and not wrongly,
../input/wav/17940.wav|for many who have recovered that we still
../input/wav/17942.wav|Yeah, those images don't get any easier to look at.
../input/wav/17943.wav|please leave. It's time for me
../input/wav/17944.wav|And I'm not saying that young people
../input/wav/17945.wav|You just hope that everyone on the federal task force
../input/wav/17946.wav|and having to share pens to fill out immigration forms.
../input/wav/17947.wav|was in total shambles. At first,
../input/wav/17948.wav|about the virus, but what he doesn't mention
../input/wav/17950.wav|putting them against each other
../input/wav/17952.wav|George W. Bush demanded the government develop
../input/wav/17953.wav|And yet, despite all of this, Trump loves to claim
../input/wav/17954.wav|because it is worth noting previous presidents
../input/wav/17955.wav|don't fully understand. People who are sick and dying
../input/wav/17956.wav|I shouldn't have to take minutes to tell you
../input/wav/17957.wav|while lounging on a bean bag
../input/wav/17958.wav|and their immediate family members
../input/wav/17959.wav|and garbage bags.
../input/wav/17960.wav|to never once releasing a comprehensive federal strategy
../input/wav/17962.wav|there was no hand sanitizer available,
../input/wav/17965.wav|going off at different times, and who one day said,
../input/wav/17967.wav|not from China, but predominantly via Europe,
../input/wav/17968.wav|not really seeing the problem here."
../input/wav/17969.wav|and suffered less. We have four times more people
../input/wav/17970.wav|and occasionally, when he's feeling generous,
../input/wav/17972.wav|let's go back to that oval office meeting
../input/wav/17973.wav|take it seriously. And it's pretty bleak
../input/wav/17974.wav|infectious-disease expert.
../input/wav/17975.wav|where more could very much have been done,
../input/wav/17977.wav|for fighting COVID, to removal of watchdog,
../input/wav/17979.wav|It's even more difficult to write a joke off of.
../input/wav/17980.wav|while his fish watches. I'm not calling the cops here,
../input/wav/17981.wav|Trump constantly undermined his own administration's advice.
../input/wav/17982.wav|that we were extremely slow to fix.
../input/wav/17987.wav|And got so openly jealous of him that when Fauci was invited
../input/wav/17989.wav|that goes a little beyond, "I played Settlers of Catan
../input/wav/17990.wav|something we might have known sooner
../input/wav/17991.wav|and yet in the years before this outbreak,
../input/wav/17992.wav|dug on Hart Island, even as hospital workers
../input/wav/17993.wav|which, you know... cool.
../input/wav/17995.wav|because Trump put the ban on China,
../input/wav/17997.wav|Yeah, that must have been incredibly frustrating.
../input/wav/17998.wav|Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services,
../input/wav/18000.wav|This wasn't inevitable. And look,
../input/wav/18001.wav|It's the Home Alone of viruses
../input/wav/18002.wav|wouldn't be allowed back into the country,
../input/wav/18003.wav|that is eerily prescient.
../input/wav/18004.wav|experts will tell you if you decide
../input/wav/18005.wav|are gonna die." And he'd say, "Like me die?
../input/wav/18008.wav|I'm not worried," is a weird thing to say
../input/wav/18010.wav|are damaging lies, staggering incompetence,
../input/wav/18011.wav|but that's just not true. Other countries have done more
../input/wav/18012.wav|and eventually starting a bidding war.
../input/wav/18014.wav|Do not share that Coke with Grandma.
../input/wav/18016.wav|that this was very much more than the flu,
../input/wav/18017.wav|And I know that the fact that we're about to talk about this at all
../input/wav/18018.wav|being constantly concerned about their health,
../input/wav/18019.wav|that the public wear masks. But Trump immediately
../input/wav/18021.wav|The first public reports of what was happening in Wuhan
../input/wav/18023.wav|We should probably all be grateful
../input/wav/18024.wav|and a team of doctors, and you are not even surrounded
../input/wav/18025.wav|and Obama created a pandemic preparedness team
../input/wav/18026.wav|the only things Trump has offered people
../input/wav/18027.wav|To saying he asked his people to slow down testing,
../input/wav/18029.wav|I know after four years it is hard
../input/wav/18030.wav|Yeah, Trump just lied. Which I know at this point
../input/wav/18031.wav|Trump had with nurses. You know,
../input/wav/18032.wav|citing concerns about what his colleagues
../input/wav/18033.wav|I mean I guess he could have not offered them pens,
../input/wav/18034.wav|they also cut CDC staff operating within China
../input/wav/18036.wav|fast enough. And decisions like that
../input/wav/18037.wav|And it's not like the administration wasn't warned here.
../input/wav/18038.wav|It's honestly difficult to say.
../input/wav/18039.wav|For what it's worth, multiple members of our staff
../input/wav/18040.wav|that he hasn't tried bottling his urine and selling it
../input/wav/18042.wav|which is obviously ridiculous as America has just four percent
../input/wav/18043.wav|undermined public messaging from the very start.
../input/wav/18044.wav|Our peace of mind, our routines,
../input/wav/18045.wav|that the CDC has been perfect during this pandemic,
../input/wav/18046.wav|you don't get to blame the previous tenant
../input/wav/18048.wav|and yet it took Trump an additional six weeks
../input/wav/18049.wav|terrible moments we haven't even had time
../input/wav/18050.wav|that placing large, non-cancellable orders
../input/wav/18051.wav|refrigerated trucks that served
../input/wav/18052.wav|and nearly a quarter of a million Americans.
../input/wav/18054.wav|are all dumb idiots. Mozart composed a minuet
../input/wav/18055.wav|The RNC even featured this video touting the heroism
../input/wav/18056.wav|and instead return to subjects we'd normally cover on this show
../input/wav/18057.wav|jetsetting all across the world, enjoying live performances
../input/wav/18058.wav|and show respect. And I'm not saying
../input/wav/18061.wav|At one point, he retweeted FireFauci.
../input/wav/18063.wav|magically end this pandemic, but he'll at least
../input/wav/18065.wav|Because just think about what medical professionals
../input/wav/18066.wav|that Trump mismanaged the pandemic.
../input/wav/18067.wav|Now, in hindsight, would warning Donald Trump
../input/wav/18068.wav|But even if he had rolled it out perfectly,
../input/wav/18069.wav|delivered by someone in a hazmat suit.
../input/wav/18070.wav|Get her her own and have it
../input/wav/18072.wav|"One, he's fucking that puppet, and two, we have to move.
../input/wav/18076.wav|as it's amplified the dangers of air travel,
../input/wav/18077.wav|Okay. I understand that impulse,
../input/wav/18078.wav|offering a clear plan to ramp up production.
../input/wav/18079.wav|It's not a crime. There's not a law
../input/wav/18080.wav|They're completely fine. They've just been busy
../input/wav/18082.wav|And all of this The lack of preparation,
../input/wav/18083.wav|he emailed everyone he could think of in the government,
../input/wav/18084.wav|of hearing about COVID. And I am sorry about that.
../input/wav/18085.wav|tend to face a defining crisis,
../input/wav/18086.wav|to cover from using this racist term multiple times
../input/wav/18087.wav|built himself a son, we have to move.
../input/wav/18088.wav|during a crisis. And they are Be first,
../input/wav/18090.wav|And for all Trump's supposed expertise as a businessman,
../input/wav/18093.wav|especially at the start of this crisis.
../input/wav/18094.wav|For many, Trump's handling of the coronavirus
../input/wav/18095.wav|including allowing US citizens, residents,
../input/wav/18096.wav|Trump himself didn't wear a mask in public until July.
../input/wav/18097.wav|To basically claiming that doctors
../input/wav/18098.wav|of front line workers, including a clip of Trump
../input/wav/18099.wav|And you'd say, "Yeah, of course,
../input/wav/18100.wav|using ski googles, snorkel masks,
../input/wav/18101.wav|It's about setting a good example.
../input/wav/18102.wav|have had to go through this year,
../input/wav/18103.wav|couldn't get a meeting with Trump to talk about it
../input/wav/18104.wav|And the thing is, Americans were listening to him.
../input/wav/18105.wav|not prevent it. All they'll do is buy you a little bit of time,
../input/wav/18106.wav|Trump encouraged states to, "get it themselves,"
../input/wav/18107.wav|and ended a pandemic early warning program.
../input/wav/18108.wav|for the rest of us? Worrying about it all the time.
../input/wav/18109.wav|to achieve that is by promoting strong,
../input/wav/18110.wav|before Congress about what that delay meant.
../input/wav/18112.wav|crucial supplies like PPE.
../input/wav/18113.wav|Has Trump done a good job handling this pandemic is,
../input/wav/18114.wav|Yeah, not really, this has been
../input/wav/18116.wav|And we covered that on this show.
../input/wav/18117.wav|and Lebron's gonna have a chase down block
../input/wav/18118.wav|that there was community spread in the US,
../input/wav/18119.wav|surprising them since they'd not actually invited him.
../input/wav/18120.wav|in this country over the past eight months
../input/wav/18122.wav|until January th. And even when he did,
../input/wav/18123.wav|I really do. But, "If he's not worried,
../input/wav/18124.wav|coordination, and communication has had real-world effects.
../input/wav/18125.wav|and ,, whose only friend was a fish,
../input/wav/18126.wav|the one that they used in the RNC video.
../input/wav/18127.wav|To suggesting sunlight and ingesting disinfectants
../input/wav/18128.wav|would make Trump roll his eys.
../input/wav/18129.wav|but his response has been such a disaster,
../input/wav/18130.wav|by more than two-thirds
../input/wav/18133.wav|the number of positive cases in the country,
../input/wav/18134.wav|to record highs all over the country.
../input/wav/18135.wav|No judgment, he fucks that puppet.
../input/wav/18136.wav|He's labeled his handling of the pandemic as "tremendous,
../input/wav/18137.wav|that something like this could happen,
../input/wav/18138.wav|And let's start with preparation
../input/wav/18139.wav|Because he offered the administration a clear way
../input/wav/18140.wav|Or just like random people." And you go, "Well,
../input/wav/18141.wav|And later, Jared fucking Kushner was made the White House lead
../input/wav/18142.wav|to give him the benefit of the doubt.
../input/wav/18143.wav|his administration's approach to managing the supply chain
../input/wav/18144.wav|Listen to these people just a few weeks later.
../input/wav/18145.wav|Trump announced he'd be doing the same for the Yankees,
../input/wav/18146.wav|Which was important, because, and I quote...
../input/wav/18147.wav|And we have three-and-a-half times more people than Vietnam,
../input/wav/18148.wav|like scented candle fraud
../input/wav/18151.wav|we acted unforgivably slowly.
../input/wav/18152.wav|But unfortunately, I can't do that
../input/wav/18156.wav|his complaint that he had empty cupboards and shelves
../input/wav/18157.wav|when that conversation took place.
../input/wav/18159.wav|That is two weeks after the first known case in the US,
../input/wav/18160.wav|to at least mitigate the damage, and they just didn't move
../input/wav/18161.wav|had already done so.
../input/wav/18162.wav|waiting for his turn to speak, so he could do his pen thing.
../input/wav/18163.wav|And he'd say, "But I'd still have my fans and rallies right?"
../input/wav/18166.wav|but Trump did the precise opposite
../input/wav/18167.wav|That was insane, right?
../input/wav/18168.wav|Trump took an appallingly long time
../input/wav/18169.wav|Our first story concerns the coronavirus.
../input/wav/18170.wav|Do you mean that he's doing the best that any president can
../input/wav/18171.wav|Yeah. To listen to Trump tell it,
../input/wav/18173.wav|and that concern hasn't gone away.
../input/wav/18174.wav|Who doesn't know that Trump fucked up this pandemic?"
../input/wav/18175.wav|as makeshift morgues, and there were mass graves
../input/wav/18176.wav|communication. Because Trump has repeatedly
../input/wav/18177.wav|It seems like the kind of thing we all already know.
../input/wav/18178.wav|Take Mike Bowen, a top executive at a PPE production company.
../input/wav/18179.wav|to a bachelor who was age somewhere between
../input/wav/18180.wav|And it's frankly pathetic that in response,
../input/wav/18181.wav|American citizens on a cruise ship
../input/wav/18182.wav|because be honest, if you lived next door
../input/wav/18183.wav|It has been genuinely remarkable just how consistently
../input/wav/18184.wav|People, panicked by Trump's announcement,
../input/wav/18185.wav|And just watch Trump respond to someone
../input/wav/18186.wav|But the administration dawdled and Bowen later testified
../input/wav/18187.wav|Trump has undercut public-health messaging.
../input/wav/18188.wav|they took effect on February nd.
../input/wav/18189.wav|And to listen to him, that's really not a problem.
../input/wav/18190.wav|And I shouldn't have to remind you
../input/wav/18191.wav|And yet, the White House denies mishandling anything.
../input/wav/18192.wav|what really matter is this
../input/wav/18195.wav|So, Trump's travel ban wasn't a ban,
../input/wav/18196.wav|is slightly undercut by the fact
../input/wav/18197.wav|And you'd say, "It might cost you the election."
../input/wav/18198.wav|whose house was full of not-for-sale handmade clocks
../input/wav/18200.wav|by a shirt.
../input/wav/18201.wav|public-health guidelines.
../input/wav/18202.wav|have done anything? You'd get into the Oval Office
../input/wav/18203.wav|isn't something that I should have to say.
../input/wav/18205.wav|that it doesn't matter what he didn't do,
../input/wav/18206.wav|In exactly five years,
../input/wav/18207.wav|In a lot of ways, the answer to the question
../input/wav/18209.wav|Also, Kumail Nanjiani's gonna get really jacked in a way
../input/wav/18210.wav|and we're all very lucky he did.
